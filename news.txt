Key points:

Bitcoin fell below the $100,000 support on Sunday, but a rebound could depend on how US stock futures open.

Bitcoin’s weakness has pulled ETH, XRP, SOL, and HYPE below their respective support levels.

Bitcoin (BTC) nosedived below the psychological $100,000 support on Sunday as traders digested the US strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Popular trader Cas Abbe said in a post on X that Bitcoin could drop toward the $93,000 to $94,000 zone before starting a reversal.

Bitcoin’s weakness has spread to several major altcoins, which have entered a deeper correction by breaking below their respective support levels. This suggests the sentiment has soured, and traders are taking risk off the table.

However, a positive sign is that analysts remain bullish on Bitcoin for the long term. Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal said in a recent video that the current crypto cycle resembles the pattern seen in 2017. He expects the crypto cycle to extend into Q2 2026.

Could Bitcoin bulls push the price back above $100,000, or will bears remain in control? Will select altcoins find buyers at lower levels? Let’s study the charts to find out.

Bitcoin price prediction

Bitcoin broke below the 50-day simple moving average ($104,788) on Friday and the $100,000 support on Sunday.

The moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the negative territory, indicating that bears are in control. If the price maintains below $100,000, the selling could intensify, pulling the BTC/USDT pair to $93,000.

Buyers will have to push the price above the 20-day exponential moving average ($104,616) to prevent the downside in the near term. The pair could then rise to the downtrend line, which is likely to pose a substantial challenge for the bulls.

The pair completed a bearish descending triangle pattern on a close below the $100,700 level. The pattern target of the negative setup is $89,420, but the bulls are unlikely to give up easily.

Buyers will try to start a relief rally, which could face selling at $100,700 and then at the 20-EMA. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the pair may deepen the correction.

The bulls will have to drive and maintain the price above the 50-SMA to start a meaningful recovery.

Ether price prediction

Ether (ETH) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($2,487) and fell below the 50-day SMA ($2,481) on Friday.

Selling continued on Saturday, and the ETH/USDT pair broke below the $2,323 support. Buyers tried to push the price back above the breakdown level of $2,323, but renewed selling by the bears has pulled the pair near the $2,111 support. The bulls will try to defend the $2,111 level with all their might because a break below it may sink the pair to $1,754.

If the price rebounds off $2,111, the bulls will have to push the pair back above the 20-day EMA to suggest that the near-term correction may have ended.

The pair could find support at the $2,111 level, but the rebound is expected to face strong selling at the breakdown level of $2,323. If the price turns down sharply from $2,323, the bears will again try to sink the pair below $2,111.

Conversely, if the bulls successfully defend the $2,111 level, the pair could form a range in the near term. The pair may swing between $2,111 and $2,323 for some time. The selling pressure could weaken on a close above the 50-SMA.

XRP price prediction

XRP’s (XRP) range between $2 and $2.65 resolved to the downside on Sunday, indicating increased selling pressure from the bears.

If the price sustains below $2, the XRP/USDT pair could tumble to the $1.61 support. Buyers are expected to vigorously defend the $1.61 level because a break below it may start a collapse to $1.28.

The bulls will have to swiftly push the price back above the breakdown level of $2 to prevent a breakdown. The pair could then rise to the moving averages, where the bears are likely to pose a strong challenge.

The bulls tried to start a bounce off the $2 support, but the bears aggressively sold near the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart. The price turned down and broke below the $2 support, pulling the RSI into the oversold territory. That suggests a relief rally is possible in the short term.

On the upside, the bears may sell the recovery attempt at $2 and above that at the 20-EMA. If the price turns down sharply from the overhead resistance, the pair risks a further downside. A close above the 50-SMA will be the first sign that the selling pressure is reducing.

Solana price prediction

Solana (SOL) completed a bearish H&S pattern when the price closed below the $140 support on Saturday.

The bulls will try to start a recovery but may face selling at the 20-day EMA ($148). If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the SOL/USDT pair could plunge to the $110 support and eventually to the pattern target of $93.

Conversely, a break and close above the 20-day EMA suggests solid demand at lower levels. The pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($160), which is likely to behave as a strong obstacle.

The downsloping moving averages signal that bears are in command, but the oversold level on the RSI points to a possible relief rally in the near term. Recovery attempts could face selling at the breakdown level of $140. If the price turns down from $140, the bears will try to resume the downward move.

Buyers will have to push and maintain the price above the 50-SMA to signal a comeback. That opens the doors for a relief rally to $149 and thereafter to $158.

Hyperliquid price prediction

Repeated failures to maintain the price above $42.50 started a sharp correction in Hyperliquid (HYPE), signaling that the bulls are hurrying to book profits.

The bulls held the 50-day SMA ($32.26) on Saturday, but the bounce has been sold into. That increases the possibility of a break below the 50-day SMA. The HYPE/USDT pair could descend to the breakout level of $28.50.

Buyers are likely to have other plans. They will try to defend the 50-day SMA and push the price back above the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the pair could climb to $40.

Both moving averages are sloping down, and the RSI is in the negative zone on the 4-hour chart. Pullbacks to the 20-EMA are likely to be sold into. There is minor support at $30.50, but it could be broken. The pair may then plummet to the solid support at $28.50.

The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 20-EMA. That suggests the bears are losing their grip. The pair may ascend to the 50-SMA, which could again attract sellers.

Ethereum whale stacks $39M despite ETH falling harder than Bitcoin

### 본문
Key takeaways:

An Ethereum whale accumulated $39 million in ETH during a sharp market sell-off triggered by US airstrikes on Iran.

Ethereum mega-whales added over 116,000 ETH on June 21, signaling strong buy-the-dip sentiment.

Technical patterns suggest ETH could rebound 25% toward $2,735 in the short term.

A high net worth Ethereum trader has accumulated tens of millions of dollars worth of Ether (ETH), defying a broader market downturn triggered by escalating Middle East tensions and fresh signs of risk aversion.

Ether’s sharp drop fails to terrify whales

The wallet address 0x7355...213 purchased roughly 9,400 ETH (~$39 million) across two major tranches on June 22, boosting its total Ether holdings to $330 million.

Its buying occurred even as Ether emerged as one of the worst-performing top cryptocurrencies over the past 24 hours.

ETH’s price fell by approximately 12.80% in the past 24 hours to reach as low as $2,155. It underperformed the top-ranking crypto, Bitcoin (BTC), which lost around 4.70% in the same period.

The downside move came as markets digested reports of a direct US military strike on Iran, marking a major escalation in the ongoing Israel–Iran conflict, which began with Israel’s “Operation Rising Lion” on June 13.

The whale actively accumulated ETH and deployed it through Lido’s liquid staking protocol despite the bearish backdrop.

The timing and scale of the purchases suggest that the whale views the sell-off as a long-term “buy the dip” opportunity rather than a cause for panic.

Glassnode’s data tracking the broader whale holding patterns suggests a similar upside sentiment.

Ethereum wallets holding 10,000 ETH or more increased their net positions both on the day the US launched airstrikes on Iran and in the days leading up to it.

On June 21, these mega-whales scooped up over 116,893 ETH worth $265.30 million, suggesting they viewed the decline as a buying opportunity, not a trigger to exit.

Ethereum is eyeing a 25% bounce

Ether is holding above a key ascending trendline that may lead to a strong bounce in the coming days, according to market analyst Sensei.

A bounce from the same support level led to a 55% rally in April-May 2025. If the pattern plays out, ETH could rebound toward the $2,735 resistance level in the short term, up about 25% from the current price levels.

Intents fix crypto&#039;s UX crisis and pave the way for agentic DeFi

Opinion by: Alex Shevchenko, co-founder of Aurora

Try to make a simple purchase with crypto today. You are forced to wrangle wallet extensions, decipher long hexadecimal addresses, select networks, sign transactions, calculate unpredictable gas fees and repeat all of these because your transactions get stuck or fail.

Sometimes, you also need to bridge assets across chains. It's a gauntlet that only a technically savvy user can complete.

Meanwhile, in traditional finance, Apple Pay completes a transaction in a single tap.

That's the bar. In crypto, the user experience remains stuck in the dial-up era.

A simpler paradigm: Just say what you want

Rather than forcing users to learn the mechanics of swaps, bridges and signing flows, intent-based architecture shifts the mental model entirely. Intents let users express their goals simply, "I want to pay $5 for this coffee," and let the system figure out the rest.

The term "intents" refers broadly to outcome-driven interactions across crypto — not just atomic crosschain swaps, but a foundational paradigm for simplifying all user actions.

Under the hood, intents are fulfilled through high-speed, trust-minimized infrastructure where trades are executed by designated actors, often market makers, rather than traditional solver networks.

Users initiate outcome-driven requests, and the back-end handles routing, execution and settlement without exposing wallets, gas fees, or chain complexity. The result is a seamless, intent-driven experience that hides infrastructure while preserving decentralized guarantees.

Crypto becomes outcome-driven, not action-driven.

Break free from the wallet mold

The wallet-centric paradigm has long defined how users interact with crypto, and it also constrained it.

A new model that removes the need for wallets entirely is already emerging. Passkey-based systems now allow users to authenticate with familiar tools like Face ID or Touch ID, eliminating seed phrases, private key management and passwords.

More importantly, an intent-based approach is chain-agnostic. Users don't need to be onboarded to a specific blockchain to transact or participate. Sending crypto becomes as simple as sharing a signed link. No app installs, no wallet setup.

This intuitive, portable interaction is ultimately key to driving mainstream adoption.

Replicate familiar financial experiences

Centralized exchanges like Binance conquered the market because they prioritized user experience. Modern intent-based infrastructure follows that familiar route of deposit, trade and withdrawal flow with comparable settlement speeds but with crucial differences.

Recent: Intent-based solutions can fix DeFi liquidity

With intents, smart contracts serve as the custody and settlement layers, maintaining secure onchain ledgers of user balances, and most crucially, publicly available proof-of-reserves. Ultra-low fees of scalable blockchains make decentralized trading practical for the first time.

This architecture is also not just for traders — it's built to provide Web2-style payment rails but with scalable, sharded, onchain infrastructure for use cases ranging from DeFi swaps to booking flights.

Intents and AI are a natural interface

Where intents are the new execution layer, AI assistants become the new interface layer.

Consider telling your assistant, "Send $50 in BTC to my brother," or "Stake my SOL for the best yield." You're not managing wallets, signing transactions or worrying about MEV — you're expressing a goal. The assistant parses your request, the solver network fulfills it via intents, and the result is seamless.

Together, AI and intents reimagine crypto UX from the ground up, finally matching (and exceeding) the elegance of traditional finance while maintaining the core tenets of decentralization.

Intents are especially critical infrastructure for an increasingly agent-driven, microtransaction-based AI economy. People are lazy and don't have time. That's why microtransactions business models failed, while subscription-based services thrive: It's complicated to authorize payments all the time, and it's easy to forget to cancel the subscription when you no longer use the service (especially with services intentionally complicating the UX to do it). This status quo won't last.

AI agents think much faster. They'll be able to optimize for price and fees, which is an easy, tangible function to automate. Once AI agents reach a certain level of adoption, services offering microtransactions will flourish simply because all agents will choose them over subscriptions.

This is the moment for blockchains to shine: Traditional payment systems like Visa and Mastercard aren't built for high-volume and conditional microtransactions. Intents will enable higher-level primitives for these financial interactions — direct payments, escrowed agreements, streamed payments, currency exchange and much more.

Beyond payments

While payments are the obvious first application, intents aren't limited to retail. They abstract away complexity from a variety of multi-step transactions:

Executing multi-hop swaps across chains

Managing crosschain asset portfolios

Placing gas-efficient limit orders in DeFi

Automating yield strategies based on dynamic conditions

This is infrastructure for the next generation of crypto apps, designed not for degen power users but for everyone.

The path forward

Crypto's unnavigable UX has been the elephant in the room for years. Intents finally represent a turning point in our industry's maturation. They mark a shift from protocol-centric design to interfaces that prioritize user intent.

Intents are outcome-driven, intuitive, and reflect the way users actually want to transact, particularly in an AI-driven future.

The true success of blockchain won't come when users understand how it works — it will come when they don't even realize they're using it.

Solana's SOL Falls 8% as Traders Brace for Fallout From a Spike in Oil Price

Solana's SOL Falls 8% as Traders Brace for Fallout From a Spike in Oil Price

Solana sank to $128.82 on heavy volume after a sharp sell-off triggered by confirmed U.S. military action against Iran.

What to know:

Solana (SOL) SOL$132.48 is trading at $128.82, down 8.33% in the past 24 hours, after a steep intraday correction linked to rising geopolitical tensions. The token dropped from $140.39 to $127.25, with the sharpest hourly decline occurring at 13:00, when sell pressure spiked and trading volume exceeded 4 million, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model.

The market reaction followed confirmed reports of U.S. military strikes targeting Iranian nuclear sites, triggering widespread risk aversion across crypto markets.

Some traders now worry that a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, even if temporary, could send oil prices soaring. That would likely stoke inflation, reduce the odds of near-term Fed rate cuts, and prolong the risk-off environment hurting crypto markets. A direct attack on the waterway could intensify the sell-off in altcoins, as bitcoin dominance historically rises during periods of geopolitical turmoil.

SOL's decline also marked a break below key technical levels, including the 200-day simple moving average near $149.54. Throughout the session, SOL printed lower highs and struggled to sustain rebounds, pointing to weakening market structure. With elevated volume on red candles and technical indicators flashing bearish, traders are now watching the $120–$125 zone as a potential support area.

Bitcoin Price Slips Below $100K, Hinting Oil-Led Risk-Off on Wall Street

Bitcoin fell below $100,000 on Sunday, its lowest point since May 8. XRP, ETH and SOL followed suit.

What to know:

Bitcoin BTC$100,887.53 fell below $100,000 on Sunday, its lowest point since May, signalling risk aversion on Wall Street on Monday amid reports that Iran is leaning towards blocking the Strait of Hormuz.

The Strait, located between Oman and Iran, connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, handling roughly 20% of the global oil trade.

Reports of Iranian politicians mulling the closure of the Strait had observers worried about a significant spike in oil prices early Monday.

"After US strikes on Iran last night, 50+ large oil tankers were scrambling to leave the Strait of Hormuz. Markets have been closed, but an immediate drop in supply is expected to send prices higher. JP Morgan described this as their worst-case scenario in the Israel-Iran war," The Kobeissi Letter said on X.

According to JPMorgan, oil could surge to $120-$130 per barrel in that scenario. That could potentially lift the U.S. inflation rate to 5%, the highest since March 2023. At the time, the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates.

The losses in BTC weighed heavily over the broader crypto market, as usual, dragging major altcoins such as XRP, SOL, and ETH lower. The payments-focused XRP slipped 6% to $1.935, the lowest since April 10. Ethereum's ether token slipped to levels seen in early May, according to CoinDesk data.

Iran Mulls Closure of Strait of Hormuz; Digital Oil Memecoin Soars 400%

An obscure token called the digital oil memecoin (OIL) surged over 400%.

What to know:

Iran's politicians leaned in favor of blocking the strategically important Strait of Hormuz on Sunday in response to the U.S. military strikes on the Iranian nuclear facilities, according to Saeed Azimi, Tehran correspondent for France 24.

"The MPs have unanimously reached this conclusion merely in a consultation capacity. The decision lies with the Supreme National Security Council," Azimi said on X, responding to several media reports, including Al Arabia, that the Parliament has approved the closure.

The Strait, a key global oil shipping route, accounts for one-fifth of the world's oil trade. Thus, the closure of the route is likely to send oil prices skyward, possibly into three figures, bolstering stagflation fears in oil-importing trade deficit nations like the U.S.

Analysts expect Brent and WTI crude prices to open significantly higher on Monday, pricing a potential supply squeeze.

In the meantime, an obscure token called the digital oil memecoin (OIL) has skyrocketed over 400% against USD, according to data source DEXTools.io. The token is listed on the Solana-based decentralized exchange Raydium.

"Fading the most geopolitically advantaged memecoin AND the ONLY coin endorsed by Peter Schiff himself? COULDN'T BE ME.... $OIL," an X handle supposedly associated with the memecoin, said on the social media platform.

The token came into existence early this year after vocal cryptocurrency and bitcoin critic Peter Schiff published a post on X supporting the idea of creating a digital oil.

<p>Let&#8217;s face it, the news cycle is a pretty gloomy place at the moment, so we&#8217;ve decided to take a different perspective. This is our attempt to find our happie place (notice the pun we&#8217;ve got going here?).<br /><br />This regular column aims to bring you positive news, flashes of inspiration and a warm, fuzzy feeling that will nourish your soul. We want to celebrate international student success and colleagues who go above and beyond. Get involved and send us the good stuff so we can share the love. <br /><br />We recognise that in this unpredictable market, real challenges exist – and that this is nothing more than a sticking plaster – but sometimes there&#8217;s strength in looking for the positives.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I was born in Lagos, but I was made in Swansea<br /><strong><sup><sub>Michael Ijaiyemakinde, international student</sub></sup></strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>This week, we decided to check in with some of the international graduates we&#8217;ve met in the UK over the years to see how they&#8217;re getting on. <br /><br />These stories are a simple reminder of why we believe in the transformational power of study abroad and the power to change individual lives (including our own). </p>



<p><strong>Franka Zlatic – Studying abroad reinvigorated my worldview<br /></strong><br />&#8220;Spending six years studying in the UK profoundly shaped my academic and personal development. <br /><br />&#8220;Immersed in a diverse, intellectually stimulating environment, I gained both theoretical grounding and the confidence to pursue independent research. Living abroad also allowed me to travel extensively across Europe and beyond, which broadened my horizons in ways I hadn’t anticipated. <br /><br />&#8220;I met people from all walks of life, encountered different worldviews, and had the time of my life – experiences that have deeply influenced how I relate to others and approach my work. Later, working at a law school in India further deepened my understanding of migration, identity, and postcolonial dynamics – topics central to my academic focus. </p>



<p></p>

<p>&#8220;Engaging with students and scholars in a culturally different yet intellectually rich context challenged me to adapt, reflect, and grow. Both experiences, academic rigour in the UK and practical, cross-cultural engagement in India, equipped me with a unique combination of analytical insight, global perspective, and resilience.</p>



<p>&#8220;Returning to my home country, Croatia, I brought back not only knowledge but also a sense of purpose and a desire to contribute to local academic debates with a broader, transnational understanding. <br /><br />&#8220;These international experiences positioned me competitively for a postdoctoral role in Croatia and reaffirmed my commitment to inclusive, globally engaged scholarship.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Michael Ijaiyemakinde – studying in Wales was the making of me<br /></strong><br />&#8220;I was born in Lagos, but I was made in Swansea.<br /><br />&#8220;Every time I say this, I get the same reaction – raised eyebrows, shocked expressions, and sometimes even pushback: you’re not patriotic.<br /><br />&#8220;But here’s what I really mean. Growing up in Nigeria, life was fast-paced, driven by results, and often defined by expectations. While it gave me resilience, it didn’t speak my love languages or give me the space to find myself. I was always doing – but rarely being.<br /><br />&#8220;At 17, I moved to study at Swansea University in Wales. Swansea&#8217;s a small city, often overlooked. But for me? It became a sanctuary. It was in Swansea that I experienced support that wasn’t transactional. I met managers, mentors, and everyday people who lived out values like empathy, service, and patience – people just like you who are reading this now.</p>

<p><br />&#8220;You didn’t just teach me – you showed me. Through kindness. Through consistency.<br /><br />&#8220;You helped me shed temper issues, rebuild my self-esteem, and rediscover my voice. Swansea didn’t change who I was. It simply gave me permission to become it.<br /><br />&#8220;What positive message am I trying to pass on here? What thoughts to help my colleagues stay positive in difficult times?<br /><br />&#8220;The right environment can change everything: not because where you’re from is bad – but because sometimes you need a new setting to unlock the next chapter of your growth. <br /><br />&#8220;Is the current environment you’re in helping you become the best version of yourself? Or is it holding you back from discovering who that version really is?<br /><br />&#8220;If not, maybe it’s time to find your Swansea.&#8221;</p>

Ambivalent response as five more unis join India’s TNE boom

<p>Just last week, the University Grants Commission formally issued LOIs to five Western institutions: the University of York and University of Aberdeen (UK), University of Western Australia, Illinois Institute of Technology (USA), and IED Istituto Europeo di Design (Italy), during an event titled ‘Mumbai Rising: Creating an International Education City’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The handover ceremony was attended by union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, UGC acting chairman Vineet Joshi, vice-chancellors of the participating universities, and diplomats from the US, UK, Italy, and Australia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The institutions can now proceed with setting up campuses in the 250-acre Edu City, an <a href="https://thepienews.com/third-mumbai-set-to-welcome-uk-us-australian-campuses/?utm_campaign=The%20PIE%20Weekly%202023&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=2&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--9fyOVKVsuLJ9yYlWMlotbeOjxy3WlkDTL-f0YvW3Kqq31NjHeGQyz-ooGrFFRm_QC3AgvSbt7r8R392zuJD1SZ3wPdA" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">upcoming education hub</a> near Navi Mumbai International Airport, currently under construction and located on the outskirts of Navi Mumbai.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While no specific launch date has been announced, the universities are expected to begin operations within an 18-month timeline, with most aiming to start their admission cycles before December 2026.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The government’s larger goal is to have at least 10 international universities in this region (Edu City)<br /><strong><sup><sub>Devendra Fadnavis, Maharashtra CM</sub></sup></strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Moreover, the campuses are set to offer fees that are 25-30% lower than what students from India currently pay for similar courses while studying abroad, according to Fadnavis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The government’s larger goal is to have at least 10 international universities in this region,” Fadnavis <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/5-foreign-universities-to-offer-courses-at-significantly-reduced-costs-cm-devendra-fadnavis-101749925567154.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">stated</a> at the event, highlighting that the emerging education hub is already being supported by key transport infrastructure.</p>



<p>Mumbai, one of India&#8217;s most cosmopolitan cities, has now entered the race to host international universities, joining the likes of GIFT City, Gurgaon, and Bangalore, where institutions such as Australia&#8217;s Deakin University and University of Wollongong (GIFT City), and the UK&#8217;s <a href="https://thepienews.com/uni-of-southampton-india-to-be-set-up-at-gurgaon-based-tech-park/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">University of Southampton</a> (set to open in a Gurgaon tech park this August), have already set up or are in the final stages of setting up. </p>



<p>“This initiative is expected to give Mumbai, known mainly for its industries, finance, and entertainment, a new identity as an academic destination,” Fadnavis added.</p>



<p><strong>How the idea of Edu City came about&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>According to Ashwin Damera, CEO of <a href="https://emeritus.org/in/universities-and-institutes/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Emeritus</a>, Mumbai was not initially on the radar for the participating universities as a campus location.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Of the five foreign universities that recently announced their decision to establish campuses in Mumbai, three had no intention of coming here. In fact, they were actively scouting other Indian cities. Mumbai wasn’t even in contention – written off early because of one factor: prohibitively expensive real estate,” read the LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ashwindamera_mumbai-activity-7340978352532434944-RWsz?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACQ5GuMBLXJrFzZLxhEyHCV_VFVbo74Y_zM" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">post</a> by Damera.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We considered several approaches, but it became clear that what was needed was structural intervention. The solution? If the government could designate and develop a dedicated education zone – an academic hub – it could fundamentally change the equation.”</p>



<p>According to Damera, the proposed solution prompted Fadnavis to view Edu City as a strategic priority, leading him to pitch the vision to international universities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In their experience, it was usually them chasing the state – not the other way around. That shift matters. Symbolism matters. Execution matters more.”</p>



<p><strong>Unis offer diverse options through India campus</strong></p>



<p>According to Sachin Jain, country manager, <a href="https://www.ets.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">ETS</a> India and South Asia, the announcement of the LOIs marks a “watershed moment”, as each of the five international universities brings distinct strengths to the table.</p>



<p>“Illinois Tech anchors the ecosystem with its reputation for engineering and technological innovation, supported by a strong research culture. The University of Aberdeen brings balanced strengths in foundational sciences and humanities, underscored by top rankings in earth sciences and human geography. </p>



<p>&#8220;The University of York adds a societal dimension through its expertise in business, public policy, and social sciences, with a strong focus on sustainability,” stated Jain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The University of Western Australia offers a global perspective with its leadership in environmental science and clean technology research. Finally, the Istituto Europeo di Design introduces a vital creative element, offering globally relevant design innovation grounded in real-world applications.”</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>An interesting aspect shared by the delegates was that they intend to recruit not just from India, but from other parts of the world for their Indian campus as well<br /><strong><sub><sup>Sushil Sukhwani, Edwise International</sup></sub></strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>While the University of York will offer undergraduate and postgraduate programs in AI, cybersecurity, business, economics, and creative industries, the University of Western Australia will focus on business and STEM fields.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the University of Aberdeen, Scotland’s first university with a soon-to-be India campus, will launch courses in computing, data science, AI, business, and later expand into public health, psychology, and film studies.</p>



<p>The first US campus in India, Illinois Institute of Technology, will offer programs in computer science, engineering, and business, with Italy’s&nbsp;IED Istituto Europeo di Design expected to focus on creative courses in fashion, product, interior design, visual communication, and digital arts.</p>



<p>“It may also be relevant to each of the institutions to offer credit-based programs that can be taken by the students within these five institutions and by the larger ecosystem outside Educity, Navi Mumbai, to bring interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary modalities to a larger student base,” added Jain.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Student recruitment: expectations and challenges</strong></p>



<p>Sushil Sukhwani, founder and director, <a href="https://www.edwiseinternational.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Edwise International</a>, said some programs could begin as early as September 2026, with the possibility of agents assisting in student recruitment.</p>



<p>“I am already in touch with one institution following this activity, and the delegates from there mentioned that they are already gearing up to give select agents in India, and from around the world, contracts to recruit for this campus,” stated Sukhwani.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“An interesting aspect shared by the delegates was that they intend to recruit not just from India, but from other parts of the world for their Indian campus as well.”</p>



<p>As UK and other international universities seek to attract “high-calibre” Indian students to their upcoming campuses, international higher education consultant Vincenzo Raimo, who has held leadership position at the University of Nottingham and University of Reading, warned that recruitment projections are often “overly ambitious,” with cost estimates frequently overlooking key overheads and the crucial role of academic staff.</p>



<p>&#8220;University leadership teams, under pressure to secure new revenue streams and demonstrate global ambition, can sometimes underestimate the complexity and cost of these ventures,&#8221; stated Raimo. </p>



<p>“When it comes to student recruitment, India is a very different proposition from other established branch campus markets such as Malaysia or China. In those contexts, we’ve seen strong demand from more cost-conscious students who might otherwise not be able to afford study abroad,&#8221; he added. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>UK institutions have not always been good at fully accounting for their own contributions, particularly academic time, quality assurance, and other institutional overheads required to support these ventures<br /><strong><sub><sup>Vincenzo Raimo</sup></sub></strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>“India’s outbound student market, however, is often driven by motivations that go beyond just the qualification such as access to international work experience, and post-study migration opportunities are also a major draw. These benefits won’t be as easily accessible to those who remain in India.”</p>



<p>Raimo further noted that while universities, especially from the UK, could boost recruitment by offering transfer options and post-study work routes, they must contribute equally to partnerships if they aim to use Indian campuses to strengthen their brand and student pipeline.</p>



<p>“In many cases, the local partner is responsible for navigating regulatory frameworks, running campus operations, and driving student recruitment, and often bearing the bulk (or all) of the capital investment,” added Raimo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“However, UK institutions have not always been good at fully accounting for their own contributions, particularly academic time, quality assurance, and other institutional overheads required to support these ventures. That poses a risk to both financial sustainability and academic integrity.”</p>



<p><strong>Why universities are aiming for &#8220;soft&#8221; courses</strong></p>



<p>According to A. Jayakrishnan, former vice-chancellor of the University of Kerala and Cochin University of Science and Technology, and ex-professor at IIT Madras, many international universities setting up in India are prioritising high-demand “soft” courses like computer science, economics, and IT, a trend seen in the country for several years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s little interest in setting up programs in mechanical or electrical engineering. Universities are choosing disciplines that are logistically simpler and more marketable to Indian students,” stated Jayakishnan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Everyone wants computer science now, not necessarily out of passion, but because that’s where the brand value and big salary packages are.”</p>



<p>Jayakrishnan noted that while affordability may remain a concern, with government support likely limited to measures like subsidised land, he also stressed the need for transparent recruitment practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, he added that the entry of international universities could offer students a “fundamentally different approach” to education.</p>



<p>“One major draw of institutions like the Illinois Institute of Technology is their teaching approach. The pedagogy is entirely different, it’s more about critical inquiry, problem-solving, and engagement,” stated Jayakrishnan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Experiencing that different pedagogical style, one that encourages real-world application, could be a real advantage for Indian students.”</p>



<p><strong>Maharashtra&#8217;s scholarship conundrum</strong></p>



<p>While the UGC has encouraged international universities setting up shop in India to offer full or partial merit- or need-based scholarships, a senior official told <em>Hindustan Times</em> that institutions will have the autonomy to make that decision.</p>



<p>The voluntary nature of offering scholarships could affect students hoping to study at these institutions, as the universities, despite potentially lower fees, retain full autonomy over their fee structures.</p>



<p>Scholarships for education have long been a contentious issue in Maharashtra, where <a href="https://thepienews.com/indian-state-marginalised-groups/?utm_content=297435058&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=linkedin&amp;hss_channel=lcp-2248093" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">restrictions</a> have previously been placed on aid for marginalised students, and government-funded scholarship schemes have faced repeated <a href="https://www.freepressjournal.in/education/maharashtra-delay-in-foreign-education-scholarship-advertisement-sparks-concern-among-students" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">delays</a>, leaving many students abroad still <a href="https://www.edexlive.com/news/2025/May/01/three-months-on-maharashtra-students-abroad-wait-for-promised-scholarship-funds" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">awaiting</a> promised disbursements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“According to a recent RedSeer report, nearly 60% of Indian students consider cost a key driver when evaluating overseas study,” stated Jain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“By offering international-quality education at a lower cost than equivalent programs abroad, domestic campuses of global institutions can remove a major barrier.”</p>

### 본문
<p>At Landmark Global Learning Ltd, we have witnessed thousands of such journeys – each one unique, each one extraordinary. When a student decides to study in another country, they’re not simply moving miles away from home. They are choosing growth over fear, curiosity over comfort, and opportunity over uncertainty. They are actually choosing a new life.</p>



<p>The decision to study abroad is one of the most powerful commitments a person can make towards their future. It’s a promise to embrace change, to learn from new cultures, to respect diversity, and to build bridges that connect nations and hearts.</p>



<p>Every year, we meet students who walk into our offices with dreams in their eyes but also with questions and doubts. Will I be able to adjust? Will I find a supportive community? Will this investment be worth it? And every year, we see these very students flourish from nervous applicants to confident global citizens. They return stronger, wiser, and ready to contribute meaningfully to the world. </p>



<p>The true magic of studying abroad lies in experiences that no classroom can offer. It’s in the friendships formed over shared meals, the late-night study sessions, the pride of representing your culture, and the small moments of realising that the world isn’t as big or as divided as it once seemed. It’s about learning to navigate life, from managing finances to cooking your first meal, from tackling language barriers to finding your own voice in a foreign land.</p>



<p>At Landmark Global Learning Ltd, we feel privileged to be part of these transformational journeys. We don’t just process applications or handle paperwork, we stand beside students and families at every step. From choosing the right course and university to guiding them through visa processes and pre-departure preparation, we ensure that every dream gets the right direction. Because to us, each student’s success is personal. It’s not just our job – it’s our passion.</p>
