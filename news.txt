Total crypto market capitalization soared back over $4 trillion on Sunday, with Ether, BNB and Dogecoin posting double-digit gains after Friday’s market crash that wiped out nearly $500 billion in crypto value.

The three blue-chip coins have surged 10.5%, 13.6% and 12.5% over the last day, while Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Chainlink (LINK) are also up over 10%, CoinGecko data shows.

Synthetix (SNX) briefly rose over 100% — eclipsing its pre-crash price level and even setting a new 2025 high — while a few other smaller-cap coins like Mantle (MNT) and Bittensor (TAO) increased over 30%.

The market crash, which saw Bitcoin fall from around $121,560 to below $103,000, was triggered by US President Donald Trump’s 100% tariff on China, as part of an attempt to place export restrictions on rare earth minerals, which are crucial for creating computer chips.

The market turmoil was exacerbated by Binance’s front end briefly showing $0 prices on several altcoins, as well as the USDe synthetic dollar depegging on Binance due to an internal oracle issue.The crypto market started to recover around the time Trump said “not to worry about China,” while adding that it wants to help China, not hurt it.

While prices haven’t fully rebounded from Friday’s crash, the recovery has many optimistic that Bitcoin (BTC) could still run toward $200,000 before the end of 2025.

Crypto market analyst Mister Crypto said that Bitcoin is retesting the golden cross —  a bullish technical pattern that has historically preceded rallies, including a 2,200% rise in 2017 and a 1,190% increase in 2020.

“The setup looks incredibly strong,” he wrote, adding that a confirmed breakout could “absolutely explode” Bitcoin’s price in the coming weeks.

Crypto trader Alex Becker said there’s a “very high chance” that this is the start of the bull market, while Jan3 founder Samson Mow added: “It’s time for Bitcoin’s next leg up.”

Another crypto analyst, “Mac,” said that while the risk-to-reward setup looks favorable, he doesn’t expect a major surge in the immediate term, but speculated that “a little more upward chop” may ensue over the next week.

Bitcoin is currently trading at $115,585, still down 4.9% from the start of the dip and about 8.8% from its $126,080 set last Monday, CoinGecko data shows.

BitMine capitalized on the dip

Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion Technologies, the largest corporate Ether (ETH) treasury company, snapped up over 128,700 ETH worth $480 million shortly after the crash, crypto analytics platform Lookonchain noted.

BitMine’s executive chairman, Tom Lee, said the stock market pullback was “overdue to an extent” given the market is up around 36% since April’s lows.

“I think it’s a good flush,” Lee told CNBC, adding that any price fall without a real structural change is a “good buying opportunity.”

Strategy may have bought the dip too

Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor hinted that his company bought the dip, posting a chart of Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings to X on Saturday with the caption: “Don’t Stop ₿elievin’”

ETH readies to reclaim $4.5K as futures markets stabilize from crypto flash crash

### 본문
Key takeaways:

ETH’s perpetual contract distortions are fading, with monthly futures signaling neutral conditions and reduced short-term market fear.

Options markets show balanced demand between bullish and bearish strategies, reflecting a healthy derivatives market.

ETH outperformed most altcoins during the crash and the following 48 hours, reinforcing its relative strength and bullish momentum.

Ether (ETH) price reclaimed the $4,100 level on Sunday, easing some of the pain from Friday’s sharp 20.7% flash crash. The $3.82 billion in leveraged long liquidations left a lasting mark on ETH derivatives markets, but four factors suggest that Ether’s rebound from the $3,750 support may have ended this short-term correction.

The funding rate on ETH perpetual futures plunged to -14%, meaning short (bearish) traders are paying to keep their positions open, an unsustainable condition over extended periods. This unusual setup likely reflects growing fears that certain market makers or even exchanges could be facing solvency issues. Whether those concerns have merit or not, traders typically act with greater caution until confidence is fully restored.

ETH derivatives signal return to normalcy despite marketwide uncertainty

Uncertainty persists over whether exchanges will reimburse clients for mismanagement tied to cross-collateral margin and oracle pricing. Binance has so far announced $283 million in compensation and indicated that other cases remain under review.

Traders are likely to remain cautious until a detailed post-mortem has been issued. Wrapped tokens and synthetic stablecoins experienced the steepest parity losses, causing traders’ margins to fall up to 50% within minutes.

ETH monthly futures absorbed the shock in less than two hours, quickly regaining the minimum 5% premium required for a neutral market. Therefore, the lack of demand for leveraged long positions in perpetual contracts likely reflects weak product design rather than strong bearish sentiment.

This distortion in the derivatives market may persist until market makers regain confidence, a process that could take weeks or even months, and should not be viewed as a bearish signal for ETH’s momentum.

Ether options markets on Deribit showed no signs of stress or unusual demand for bearish strategies. Trading volumes over the weekend remained normal, and activity in put (sell) options was slightly lower than in call (buy) options, signaling a balanced and healthy market.

This data helps ease concerns about a coordinated cryptocurrency market crash. A sharp rise in options volume would likely have occurred if traders had been anticipating a major price drop. Therefore, whatever triggered the cascading liquidations and instability in ETH derivatives markets has caught traders entirely off guard.

ETH historical performance, spot ETFs and derivatives distance themselves from competitors

More importantly, a handful of major altcoins experienced intraday corrections far deeper than Ether’s 20.7%, including the extreme cases of SUI (SUI) at 84%, Avalanche (AVAX) at 70%, and Cardano (ADA) down 66%. Ether has fallen 5% in the past 48 hours, while most competitors remain roughly 10% below their pre-crash levels.

Ether’s decoupling from the broader altcoin market highlights the strength provided by its $23.5 billion in spot exchange-traded funds and $15.5 billion in open interest on options markets. Even if Solana (SOL) and other rivals enter the spot ETF race, Ether’s established network effects and resilience during volatile periods continue to make it the top altcoin choice for institutional capital.

Ether’s outlook remains strong as confidence in derivatives structures gradually returns, supporting a potential recovery toward the $4,500 resistance level.

Today in crypto, US and China representatives signal easing trade tensions, Bitcoin is retesting the golden cross, a bullish pattern that preceded past parabolic rallies. Meanwhile crypto traders’ “typical rationalization” behavior by pointing to Trump’s tariffs as the reason for the market dump.

US and China representatives signal easing trade tensions

Representatives from the United States and China eased the heated rhetoric around trade policies after tensions between the two countries flared up this week due to China’s export controls on rare earth minerals and US President Donald Trump's announcement of an additional 100% tariff on China.

China’s Ministry of Commerce signaled a willingness to negotiate on the rare earth export control proposal and other trade issues on Sunday, which came alongside a statement from Trump. In a Sunday Truth Social post, Trump wrote:

“Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want depression for his country, and neither do I. The USA wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”

Market analysts said that signs of de-escalation from Trump could pump financial markets on Monday, reversing the price decline that impacted crypto markets over the weekend.

Bitcoin retests golden cross, a break above could trigger major rally: Analyst

Bitcoin is retesting the “golden cross,” a bullish technical pattern that has historically preceded rallies, according to crypto market analyst Mister Crypto.

In a Sunday post on X, the analyst shared a chart noting that Bitcoin’s (BTC) previous golden crosses led to gains of 2,200% in 2017 and 1,190% in 2020. With BTC currently hovering near $110,000, he suggested that holding above the level could ignite another parabolic move.

“The setup looks incredibly strong,” he wrote, adding that a confirmed breakout could “absolutely explode” Bitcoin’s price in the coming weeks.

A golden cross is a bullish trading signal that happens when a short-term moving average, usually the 50-day, crosses above a long-term moving average, often the 200-day. It signals that momentum is shifting from bearish to bullish, meaning prices may start rising.

Crypto traders blame Trump’s tariffs in search of ‘singular event’: Santiment

Crypto retail traders were quick to blame Friday’s broader crypto market decline on US President Donald Trump announcing a 100% tariff on China, as they often look for something to point the finger at during downturns, according to Santiment.

Analysts, however, say the reason for the market slump runs deeper than the tariffs alone.

“This is typical 'rationalization' behavior from retailers, who need to point to a singular event as the reason for a cataclysmic downturn in crypto,” Santiment said in a report on Saturday.

“After the crash, the crowd quickly jumped to collectively come to a consensus as to what the flush could be attributed to,” Santiment said, referring to the increase in social media discussions related to both the crypto market and US-China tariff concerns.

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino: ‘Bitcoin and Gold Will Outlast Any Other Currency’

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino: ‘Bitcoin and Gold Will Outlast Any Other Currency’

Paolo Ardoino’s latest comment about bitcoin and gold echoes Tether’s policy of buying BTC with profits and building up gold exposure.

What to know:

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said in a post on X on Sunday that "Bitcoin and Gold will outlast any other currency," a minimalist line that aligns with how the stablecoin issuer has positioned parts of its reserves over the past two years.

On May 17, 2023, Tether said it would regularly allocate up to 15% of net realized operating profits to purchase bitcoin for reserves, adding BTC to surplus rather than using it to back circulating USDT one-for-one. The company framed the move as strengthening its balance sheet with a long-term store of value.

BTC and gold as parallel pillars

Gold sits alongside bitcoin in that mix.

Tether issues tether gold (XAUt), a token backed by allocated bars, and said on July 24 that more than 7.66 tons of metal backed outstanding tokens as of June 30, 2025. Separately, as CoinDesk reported on Sept. 5, 2025, citing the Financial Times, Tether has held talks to invest across the gold value chain — from mining and refining to royalties — as part of a broader diversification push.

Ardoino has grouped the assets rhetorically before. On Sept. 7, he referenced bitcoin, gold and land as hedges and later dismissed suggestions that Tether sold BTC to accumulate gold, saying the firm remained committed to growing its bitcoin position.

Today's eight-word post is less a policy shift than a restatement — bitcoin as a strategic asset added with profits, and gold as a parallel pillar via tokenization and potential upstream investments — while most reserves remain in liquid instruments such as U.S. Treasurys per attestations. The next reserve report, expected late this month or early next month, will show whether allocations to BTC and gold have changed.

As of Sunday, 8:10 p.m. UTC, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) was down 8.88% year to date, while bitcoin and gold — BTC-USD and XAU-USD — were up 22.79% and 52.91%, respectively, according to MarketWatch.

Altcoins Cratered in Oct. 10 Crypto Flash Crash as Bitcoin Held Up, Wiston Capital Says

Wiston Capital's Charlie Erith says a leverage cascade drove the Oct. 10 break, with altcoins hit hardest, and lays out the signals he will track before adding risk.

What to know:

Friday’s crypto sell-off was a fast, leverage-driven cascade that crushed altcoins while bitcoin held up comparatively better — and the next phase hinges on a handful of signals, according to Wiston Capital Founder Charlie Erith.

In a Sunday post titled “Crypto Crumble,” Erith said the market excluding bitcoin, ether and stablecoins fell about 33% in roughly 25 minutes on Oct. 10 before bouncing to a loss of around 10.6%. He added that about $560 billion, or 13.1%, has been erased from total crypto market value since Oct. 6 and cited $18.7 billion in liquidations during the episode.

He linked the immediate trigger to President Donald Trump’s Truth Social threat of an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports, but argued the slide was already in motion — equities were still climbing while crypto “felt distinctly frail,” a divergence he took as advance warning.

Bitcoin, he said, “behaved largely as expected.” It fell, but less than the long tail, leaving bitcoin near a long-running uptrend from late 2022 and boosting its market share as non-bitcoin tokens absorbed “immense technical damage.” Erith said his fund emerged “largely unscathed” because positioning had already been defensively tilted.

What Erith is watching next

Erith said he is tracking bitcoin’s 365-day exponential moving average as a line that separates bullish from corrective regimes. He added that a pullback toward the $100,000 area and a touch of that average would not, by itself, overturn his longer-term view provided the level holds — but a sustained break would raise the risk of a deeper reset.

He also pointed to market breadth via bitcoin’s share of total crypto value. According to Erith, the sell-off accelerated a rotation toward higher-liquidity assets, lifting bitcoin dominance. He said a continued rise in that share alongside weak breadth would argue for caution in high-beta tokens until non-bitcoin charts rebuild.

Beyond bitcoin’s own levels, Erith highlighted Strategy’s equity as a proxy for leverage and sentiment in the ecosystem. He noted that roughly four years ago a decisive move below its 365-day average preceded a major bitcoin drawdown. In his view, holding above that trend line would support the resilience narrative; a break below could foreshadow renewed selling pressure.

Volatility is the other gauge. Erith said the VIX — the equity “fear index” — has started to climb and that historically better entries arrive when volatility spikes rather than during the early rise. That framing implies patience on adding risk while equity-volatility stress plays out.

On positioning, Erith said he remains invested but is avoiding leverage and is carrying cash “waiting for the dust to settle.” He said moves of this sort have, in his experience, sometimes preceded broader downturns, which is why he prefers to see the above signals stabilize before increasing exposure.

Erith said the sell-off inflicted heavy damage on altcoins, while bitcoin’s month-to-date decline is modest and comparable to large-cap tech, which he views as evidence of growing resilience.

Binance to Compensate Users Affected by Crash in wBETH, BNSOL, and Ethena’s USDe

Wrapped tokens crashed as Binance's infrastructure buckled, making it harder for market makers to stabilize prices.

What to know:

Binance has voluntarily announced compensation for users who incurred losses due to platform's disruptions late Friday that triggered a significant price crash in wrapped beacon ether (wBETH), Binance Staked SOL (BNSOL), and Ethereum's synthetic dollar USDe.

"Due to significant market fluctuations over the past 16 hours and a substantial influx of users, some users have encountered issues with their transactions. I deeply apologize for this. If you have incurred losses attributable to Binance, please contact our customer service to register your case," Yi He, co-founder and chief customer officer at Binance, said on X.

He added that the exchange will review account activity on a case-by-case basis to determine compensation, emphasizing that losses due to market fluctuations and unrealized profits are not eligible for compensation.

Binance's wrapped beacon ether (wBETH) price plunged to as low as $430 around 21:40 UTC on Friday, representing a staggering 88% discount compared to the ether-tether (ETH/USDT) spot price, which was trading above $3,800 at the same time.

The Binance Staked SOL (BNBSOL) also tanked to $34.90, trading at a massive discount to the spot price of solana. Meanwhile, Ethena's synthetic dollar USDe, which uses the delta neutral cash-and-carry, slipped rapidly to 65 cents around the same time as wBETH and BNBSOL crashed.

Explaining the crash

Tokens like wBETH and BNBSOL are designed to track the spot price of their underlying assets closely.

Binance valued these wrapped assets based on their spot market prices, as noted by AltLayer founder YQ Jia on X. Under normal conditions, arbitrageurs help maintain these prices close to their fundamental values by simultaneously buying the cheaper asset and selling the more expensive one.

However, as Binance's infrastructure came under stress due to increased market volatility and massive liquidations, market makers and arbitrageurs couldn't access the primary markets and execute trades efficiently, causing a breakdown in price alignment. It led to a crash in wrapped tokens.

"Binance represents perhaps 50% of global spot volume. When they [market makers] can't access Binance—either to hedge positions or even see prices—they're flying blind. Would you provide bids for wBETH at $2,000 when you can't see what's happening on the largest market? Of course not," Jia noted.

Jia added that market makers' inability to participate created a liquidity vacuum, reminiscent of portfolio insurance in 1987 – "mechanisms designed for normal markets that become procyclical accelerants during crashes."

Corrective measures

Within 24 hours of the crash, Binance announced a shift to using conversion-ratio pricing for wrapped assets.

Instead of valuing wBETH based on volatile and distressed spot market trades, the exchange would now price it according to the underlying staking ratio, which represents the actual amount of ETH each wrapped token represents.

The change means a more stable and accurate valuation during times of market stress by disconnecting wrapped token prices from short-term spot market fluctuations.

MIT rejects Trump’s preferential funding offer

### 링크
https://thepienews.com/mit-rejects-trumps-preferential-funding-offer/

### 본문
<p>MIT president Saly Kornbluth said the agreement went against freedom of expression and the university’s independence, and that it was <a href="https://orgchart.mit.edu/letters/regarding-compact" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">“fundamentally”</a> inconsistent with MIT’s “core belief that scientific funding should be based on scientific merit alone”. </p>



<p>Last week, the Trump administration sent a <a href="https://thepienews.com/us-moots-15-international-student-cap-on-institutions/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">compact</a> to nine US colleges laying out sweeping demands including capping international enrolments, banning the use of race or sex in hiring and freezing tuition for five years. In return, schools that signed on would receive competitive advantages from the government.  </p>



<p>In a letter to US education secretary Linda McMahon, Kornbluth said: “We must hear facts and opinions we don’t like – and engage respectfully with those whom we disagree.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the terms of the compact, signatories must abolish university units that “punish” or “belittle” conservative ideas, and all college employees “must abstain in their official capacity from actions or speech related to politics”.  </p>



<p>If adopted by the institutions, it would set a 15% cap on international undergraduate students including a 5% limit for any given country. It also stipulates that universities must hand over international student information, including discipline records, upon the request of the government.  </p>



<p>MIT is the first of the nine institutions to officially respond to the administration before the October 20 deadline. Stakeholders said the White House is likely aiming to expand the compact if institutions engage.  </p>



<p>The day after it was sent, the University of Texas swiftly announced it was “honoured” to be a part of Trump&#8217;s proposal, though the remaining institutions were notably quiet on the agreement, which has received strong pushback from faculty leadership and administrators. </p>



<p>Faculty senates at the University of Virginia and the University of Arizona voted to <a href="https://facultysenate.virginia.edu/resolution-opposing-compact-academic-excellence-higher-education" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">oppose</a> the compact with overwhelming majorities, while Dartmouth College president said in a <a href="https://president.dartmouth.edu/news/2025/10/response-compact-academic-excellence-higher-education" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">statement</a> she was “deeply committed” to the university’s values and would always defend its “fierce independence”.  </p>



<p>In Tennessee, academic and workers unions have called on Vanderbilt University to reject what they called &#8220;Trump’s Fascist Compact”, with a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScwxNE3-WLbD1cDBAmmiINgOsLgfSI89048zhOoU5cFlGH2cg/viewform" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">petition</a> from Graduate Workers United garnering almost 1,000 signatures as of October 8. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Elsewhere, California governor Gavin Newsom quickly responded saying: “California universities that bend to the will of Donald Trump and sign this insane ‘compact’ will lose billions in state funding – IMMEDIATELY.”</p>



<p>“California will not bankroll schools that sign away academic freedom,” he wrote on October 2, sending a clear sign to the University of Southern California (USC), the only Californian college to receive the proposal so far.  </p>



<p>Alongside MIT, the compact demands were thrust upon: Vanderbilt University, Dartmouth College, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, the University of Texas, the University of Arizona, Brown University and the University of Virginia. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>California universities that bend to the will of Donald Trump and sign this insane ‘compact’ will lose billions in state funding – IMMEDIATELY</p>
<cite>Gavin Newsom, Governor of California</cite></blockquote>



<p>While it remains unclear how the recipients were chosen, stakeholders have noted that the list includes high prestige universities as well as public flagships, likely to generate maximum sectoral and media impact. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“The compact forces all nine institutions to reveal their positions; it sets the narrative for media reporting and public discussion of the points in the compact; and starts a public sorting of university responses to these policy priorities,” Boston College professor Chris Glass told <em>The PIE News.</em> </p>



<p>Whether MIT’s response emboldens the universities to reject the proposal remains to be seen, but even without the signatures, “the compact creates lasting ripples, as universities, accreditors, and state officials recalibrate for future policy fights,” said Glass.<em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The compact&#8217;s international student cap is yet another clear sign of Trump’s anti-immigration stance, though experts have noted that none of the nine universities have undergraduate international student populations that exceed the 15% limit.  </p>



<p>While U Penn and USC are both close to the threshold with international undergraduate populations around the 14% mark, the universities of Virginia, Arizona and Texas at Austin all enrol less than 6% international undergraduates, according to <a href="https://www.collegetowns.org/p/no-international-students-are-not" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">analysis</a> by Soka University of America professor Ryan Allen. </p>



<p>As such, Glass speculated the cap was intended to signal to universities beyond the nine, especially those above the 15% threshold, that they may face future scrutiny. </p>



<p>“Just by introducing the cap, the administration sets the terms of debate and sends a strong message – to its base, to all universities in the US, and to prospective international students,” he said. </p>



<p>As per Allen’s analysis, just 14 of the top 114 US universities have undergraduate international populations that exceed the proposed limit. </p>



<p>If it is implemented, the impact of the cap by itself might not be significant, &#8220;but this is part of an overall message that the US does not want international students &#8230; It’s tough to grapple with in the classroom because our students are feeling that message,” said Allen. </p>



<p>Typically, international students make up a larger proportion of postgraduate than undergraduate enrolments, though universities rarely disaggregate the two in overall student counts. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And yet: “Undergrad admissions are much more contentious and political than grad school. So, the idea that international students are somehow taking seats from Americans is much more salient in that space,” said Allen. &nbsp;</p>

Canada: 47k int’l students flagged for potential visa non-compliance

### 본문
<p>Aiesha Zafar, assistant deputy minister for migration integrity at IRCC, told the House of Commons Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration that 8% of international students reviewed were potentially “non-compliant&#8221;, meaning they were not attending classes as required by the terms of their study visa.</p>



<p>“In terms of the total number of students we asked for compliance information from, that results in potentially 47,175. We have not yet determined whether they are fully non-compliant, these are initial results provided to us by institutions,” stated Zafar, who was questioned by Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner about where these students are currently, if they are not complying with their visa terms.</p>



<p>Determining full non-compliance of the international students, however, is not straightforward, as institutions report data at varying intervals, and students may change schools, graduate, or take authorized leaves.</p>



<p>Zafar noted that IRCC shares all the data it continually collects with the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), which is responsible for locating and removing non-compliant visa holders.</p>



<p>“Any foreign national in Canada would be under the purview of the CBSA, so they have an inland investigation team,” Zafar told the committee when Garner questioned how the IRCC is able to track and remove students who are in violation of their visas. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The 47,000 non-compliance cases are a backlog, evidence that fraud detection is strengthening, not weakening, Canadian standards<br /><sub><strong><sup>Maria Mathai, M.M Advisory Services</sup></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to Maria Mathai, founder of <a href="https://www.mdotm.in/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">M.M Advisory Services</a>, which supports Canadian universities in the South Asian market, the figure of over 47,000 students who could be non-compliant being portrayed as a “crisis” misses the real story — that Canada’s immigration system is actively adapting.</p>



<p>&#8220;Front-end Provincial Attestation Letter (PAL) screening now blocks thousands who would have entered before, and ongoing oversight is catching legacy issues. The 47,000 non-compliance cases are a backlog, evidence that fraud detection is strengthening, not weakening, Canadian standards,&#8221; Mathai told <em>The PIE News</em>. </p>



<p>Mathai acknowledged that past PAL allocations contributed to compliance challenges, with regions like Ontario, which hosts the largest share of international students, directing most of its PALs to colleges with higher default rates. </p>



<p>However, the situation is expected to change with IRCC now imposing strict provincial caps on the number of study permits each province can issue.</p>



<p>&#8220;By surfacing these imbalances now, the new framework is encouraging provinces and institutions to adapt entry practices based on evidence and learning,&#8221; stated Mathai. </p>



<p>Canada’s international student compliance regime, in effect since 2014, was established to identify potentially non-genuine students.</p>



<p>It includes twice-yearly compliance reporting conducted in partnership with Designated Learning Institutions (DLIs), Canadian colleges, institutes, and universities authorised to host international students.</p>



<p>While IRCC’s 2024 report noted no recourse against non-reporting DLIs, new rules now allow such institutions to be <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/notices/2025-provincial-territorial-allocations-under-international-student-cap.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">suspended</a> for up to a year.</p>



<p>Moreover, Canada’s struggle with international students not showing up for classes is not new, with reports earlier this year indicating nearly 50,000 instances of <a href="https://thepienews.com/canadian-institutions-log-almost-50k-no-shows-in-just-two-months/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">“no-shows”</a>, international students who failed to enrol at their institutions, in the spring of 2024.</p>



<p>While the “no-show” cohort included 4,279 Chinese students, 3,902 Nigerian students, and 2,712 Ghanaian students, Indian students accounted for the largest share at 19,582. It highlights a broader issue of immigration fraud originating from India, which Zafar identified as one of the top countries for such cases during her September 23 committee testimony.</p>



<p>Over a quarter of international students seeking <a href="https://thepienews.com/students-five-countries-represent-over-50-of-asylum-applications-in-canada/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">asylum</a> in Canada also came from India and Nigeria. </p>



<p>According to Pranav Rathi, associate director of international recruitment at<a href="https://www.fanshawec.ca/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"> Fanshawe College</a>, which hosts one of the largest numbers of Indian students in Ontario, a “rigorous approach” has led to about 20% of Indian applications being declined to ensure only qualified candidates proceed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Each application is carefully reviewed, and checked for aggregate scores, backlogs, and authenticity of mark sheets. We keep ourselves updated with the recognised institution list published by UGC,&#8221; stated Rathi. </p>



<p>&#8220;It is mandatory for a student to provide English language tests approved by IRCC and we also verify English proficiency through IELTS or equivalent test reports to confirm readiness for study in Canada.&#8221;</p>



<p>Rathi suggested that one reason Indian students often appear among potentially non-compliant or “no-show” cases is a systemic issue that previously allowed them to change institutions after receiving a study permit. </p>



<p>He added that schools now need to take a more active role, particularly when students apply through education agents.</p>



<p>&#8220;Institutions should ensure that their representatives are transparent, well-trained, and follow ethical recruitment practices that align with institutional and regulatory standards,&#8221; stated Rathi. </p>



<p>&#8220;Ongoing collaboration between institutions and government bodies to monitor market trends and share insights can help build a more transparent and sustainable international education system.&#8221;</p>



<p>Many Canadian institutions are now facing headwinds, with course offerings and research funding being cut as Canada’s study permit refusal rate has <a href="https://thepienews.com/canada-rejects-nearly-two-in-three-study-permit-applicants/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">climbed</a> to its highest level in over a decade.</p>



<p>Canadian politicians have also intensified scrutiny of institutions across the country. </p>



<p>Just days after the IRCC testimony on non-compliant students, a federal committee hearing led by MP Garner saw Conestoga College president John Tibbits questioned on issues ranging from his $600,000 salary to allegations of “juicing foreign student permits” amid growing concerns that healthcare, housing, and jobs that “don’t have capacity&#8221; in Ontario.</p>



<p>&#8220;Colleges, including Conestoga, have been subject to scrutiny about the role international [students] play in housing, affordability and community pressures. I welcome the opportunity to reaffirm that Conestoga’s approach has always been about service. Our mission has always been to ensure the communities we serve have access to the skilled labour force they need to survive,&#8221; stated Tibbits,  while addressing the committee on Thursday. </p>



<p>“Looking ahead, we believe this is the time to stabilize the system to build an international student program that is sustainable, fair, globally competitive and focused on Canada’s economic priorities,&#8221; he added, as <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/kitchener/article/conestoga-colleges-president-faces-criticism-at-federal-committee/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> by <em>CTV News</em>. </p>

UK higher education TNE enrolments close gap with onshore international students

### 본문
<p>A <a href="https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/sites/default/files/field/downloads/2025-10/UUKi%20Scale%20of%20TNE%202023-24%20summary%20report.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">new report</a> from Universities UK International (UUKi) shows that as of 2023/24, there were 653,570 students studying at UK institutions overseas – just over 50,000 less than the number of onshore international students recruited to the UK (704,405).</p>



<p>With UK international student recruitment dipping by 4.2% between 2022/23 and 2023/24 and UK TNE students in higher education growing by 7.8% in the same period, the number of students educated by UK institutions abroad could soon outnumber onshore international students recruited to the UK.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-259297" height="576" src="https://thepienews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/UUKi-graph-1024x576.webp" style="width: 1160px; height: auto;" width="1024" /></figure>



<p>Presenting the report at the UUKi TNE conference this week, the organisation&#8217;s head of transnational education Griff Ryan said it could be difficult to predict long-term trends – particularly after a few years of unpredictability in the market.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you just project forward that same reduction rate for international students and growth for TNE students, that would mean that we would see TNE student numbers overtake international student numbers from the 2024/25 academic year,&#8221; Ryan noted. &#8220;Whether that is going to play out or not is potentially a different story. We all know what a rollercoaster it is to predict or forecast the number of international students from year to year, especially over the past few years of volatility&#8221;.</p>



<p>While he stressed that he was not forecasting trends, he noted that student visa numbers were a good indication of interest in studying in the UK. These hit a peak in 2022, plateaued in 2023 and dropped sharply in 2024, he said, suggesting that further dips might be on the horizon.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I certainly wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see an increasing number of TNE students reflected in the 2024/25 [HESA] data<br /><strong><sub><sup>Griff Ryan, UUKi</sup></sub></strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>&#8220;Trying to predict the TNE numbers is a bit more tricky,&#8221; he warned. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have as helpful as a lead indicator as we do with the student visas.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;However, given the level of sectoral interest and investment in TNE has certainly been building&#8230; I certainly wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see an increasing number of TNE students reflected in the 2024/25 [HESA] data,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>The report also revealed that global demand for UK TNE provision is on the rise – with notable gains in student numbers over the past five years in Saudi Arabia (+142.2%), Sri Lanka (+104.2%) and the UAE (+88.1%).</p>



<p>Meanwhile, demand for UK TNE is surging across Asia, with demand over the past five years growing notably in Vietnam (+233.9%), Nepal (+107.5%), Pakistan (+103%) and India (78.1%).</p>



<p>The news comes in the same week as Lancaster University announced it is <a href="https://thepienews.com/lancaster-joins-india-boom-with-new-bengaluru-campus/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">set to open</a> new branch campus in India&#8217;s tech epicentre Bengaluru, following in the footsteps of several other high profile Indian TNE ventures from UK universities over the past year. </p>



<p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is fresh from a <a href="https://thepienews.com/starmer-rules-out-visa-changes-promotes-uk-unis-during-india-visit/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">two-day trip </a>to India to cement a trade deal between the two nations. During the visit, he brought with him a delegation of 13 UK university vice-chancellors in the delegation, with hopes that there will be new opportunities for UK institutions seeking TNE opportunities.</p>
