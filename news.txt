Telegram founder Pavel Durov warned that France may experience a societal collapse if it continues down its current political trajectory of censorship and regulatory policies during an interview on Wednesday.

“Emmanuel Macron isn’t making the right choices. I’m very disappointed. France is getting weaker and weaker,” Durov said in a translated excerpt from an interview with French outlet Le Point. Durov added:

"If you raise one or two generations with a certain mindset, it then takes decades to change it. If we continue to waste time, the risk increases that the country will have to undergo very extreme changes.

When we delay necessary reforms too long, we end up experiencing a collapse,” the Telegram founder continued, warning that France was losing talent to other jurisdictions like Dubai.

In early June, Durov appeared for an interview with Tucker Carlson, as the Telegram founder continued his media campaign following his August 2024 arrest in France.

The arrest drew widespread condemnation from the crypto community, civil rights activists and human rights foundations, which continue to monitor the case of Durov and its implications for free speech, self-expression, and political opinion in the digital age.

Claims that French intelligence sought to censor EU election content

The Telegram founder also recounted claims that French intelligence services asked him to censor pro-conservative content related to the May 2025 Romanian presidential election.

Durov said that Nicolas Lerner, the head of French intelligence services, approached him at the Hôtel de Crillon and asked to censor the content on the platform, a request he says he denied.

Durov argued that laws like the European Union’s Digital Services Act are a trojan horse for censorship cloaked as consumer protection regulations and vehicles to fight misinformation or promote online safety.

“These laws are dangerous because they can be used against those who created them. Today, they target those labeled conspiracy theorists. Tomorrow, they may target their authors,” Durov said in the interview.

Here’s what happened in crypto today

Today in crypto, China’s central bank is establishing an international operations center to broaden the global reach of its digital yuan. In Iran, crypto exchange Nobitex was reportedly hacked by a group linked to Israel. Meanwhile, several publicly traded companies have raised hundreds of millions of dollars to increase their crypto holdings.

Chinese Central Bank pledges global expansion of digital yuan — Report

China’s central bank chief Pan Gongsheng has pledged to expand the footprint of the digital yuan, reaffirming the country’s vision for its central bank digital currency (CBDC).

According to a Reuters report, China is creating an international operations center in Shanghai for the digital yuan, also known as e-CNY. Pan made the remarks at the Lujiazui Forum, a professional forum for high-profile local and international finance regulators and executives.

China envisions a “multipolar” currency system where multiple currencies support the global economy, Pan said. This vision contrasts with the current system, where a few currencies, like the US dollar and the euro, play large roles in the global financial system.

The US dollar, in particular, may have become less appealing to investors in 2025, partly due to the unscripted rollout of tariffs by US President Donald Trump over the past months.

Pan also weighed in on digital technologies, claiming that traditional cross-border payment systems are vulnerable to geopolitical risk.

“Traditional cross-border payment infrastructures can be easily politicized and weaponized, and used as a tool for unilateral sanctions, damaging global economic and financial order," he said.

Iranian exchange Nobitex hacked for over $81 million by Israel-linked hackers

Iran-based cryptocurrency exchange Nobitex has been hacked for more than $81 million of digital assets, according to onchain investigator ZachXBT.

The attack, disclosed in a Wednesday Telegram post, drained at least $81.7 million in assets across the Tron network and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchains.

ZachXBT spotted attackers using a “vanity address” to exploit the protocol, which resulted in “suspicious outflows” from multiple Nobitex-linked wallets.

A vanity address refers to a public wallet address with a specific, user-defined sequence of characters. The first $49 million was stolen through the address “TKFuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXy2r7mNX.” The second address used was “0xffFFfFFffFFffFfFffFFfFfFfFFFFfFfFFFFDead,” according to Tronscan.

A pro-Israel hacker group calling itself “Gonjeshke Darande” has claimed responsibility for the Nobitex hack.

Nobitex confirmed that a portion of its hot wallets saw signs of “unauthorized access” and was immediately “suspended” upon detection.

“Users’ assets are completely secure according to cold storage standards, and the above incident only affected a portion of the assets in hot wallets,” Nobitex said in an X post, adding that “all damages will be compensated through the insurance fund and Nobitex resources.”

The Nobitex exploit “appears to stem from a critical failure in access controls, allowing attackers to infiltrate internal systems and drain hot wallets across multiple blockchains,” according to Hakan Unal, senior security operations lead at blockchain security firm Cyvers.

“Yet, surprisingly, the stolen funds remain unmoved,” Unal said.

The breach adds to a growing list of crypto industry hacks in 2025. More than $2.1 billion in digital assets have been stolen so far this year, according to blockchain security firm CertiK.

Four public US firms to spend $844 million on Bitcoin, HYPE

At least three publicly-traded US firms said on Tuesday that they would spend a total of nearly $800 million buying Bitcoin (BTC), while another said it raised $50 million to buy the Hyperliquid (HYPE) token.

The heat-and-eat meal seller DDC Enterprise Ltd said it entered into three purchase agreements totaling $528 million, all of which will be used to expand the firm’s Bitcoin holdings, which was partly backed by the venture capital arm of Animoca Brands.

Bitcoin financial services firm Fold Holdings Inc also said on Tuesday that it secured a $250 million equity purchase facility, with the net proceeds “primarily intended” to fund additional Bitcoin purchases.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining equipment rental firm BitMine Immersion Technologies finished its purchase of $16.3 million worth of Bitcoin using proceeds from a recent stock offering.

Eyenovia, a digital eye exam tech developer, said it would set aside $50 million to buy HYPE, the token of the decentralized crypto derivatives exchange. The firm said it would also rebrand to “Hyperion DeFi” under the ticker HYPD.

Hybrid learning delivers the power skills international students need to succeed

### 본문
<p>In the past five years, the conversation around K-12 education has shifted dramatically from “what subjects are we teaching?” to “what skills are we building?” </p>



<p>And nowhere is this more evident than in international hybrid learning, where online models are empowering students to master the <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/power-skills-rebranding/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">power skills</a> that today’s universities and employers are desperate for.</p>



<p>Today, power skills – critical thinking, cross-cultural fluency, self-management, and adaptability – are at the top of every hiring manager’s list. What’s driving the shift? AI is rapidly automating routine tasks, but it can’t lead a team meeting, navigate a conflict, or spark innovation. </p>



<p>As the <em>Financial Times</em> recently reported, AI is pushing employees’ work toward “higher-value, human-centric tasks.” In response, companies are redesigning roles and urgently seeking employees who are not only tech-savvy but also resilient, adaptable, and ready to lead.</p>



<p>Today’s students will need power skills to succeed in the modern world. These aren’t optional, they’re essential. And hybrid learning environments, especially those built on US curriculum frameworks, are producing them at scale.</p>



<p><strong>Critical thinking: learning that isn’t About memorisation</strong></p>



<p>Hybrid learning challenges students to solve real problems, not just repeat facts. Courses like AP® Computer Science and Intro to AI require students to think analytically, connect ideas, and apply what they’ve learned.</p>



<p>In a well-designed hybrid course, questions aren’t just factual. Teachers employ critical thinking questions such as, “why do you think this is the best approach? What makes you think that?” or “what might be a better solution?” These are questions that encourage students to evaluate, compare, and defend their thinking.</p>



<p><a href="https://go.hudsonglobalscholars.com/the-pie-news" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Hudson Global Scholars</a> student Guillermo Oropeza of Mexico shared that taking hybrid AP® courses helped him to think critically, test solutions, and refine his logic. “I like to challenge myself, and the program helped me do that,” he said. “I definitely felt like I was outside my comfort zone.”</p>



<p>When students encounter unfamiliar topics in a second language, as many Hudson students do, their engagement tends to deepen. They aren’t just consuming content but analysing information through the lens of their own experience and using new insights and skills gained to redefine their future.</p>



<p><strong>Communication: more than just language fluency</strong></p>



<p>In the international workplace, the ability to communicate clearly, collaborate across cultures, and self-manage is the real differentiator.</p>



<p>In the global classroom, communication extends beyond English mastery. It’s about listening, collaborating, presenting ideas clearly, and building relationships across cultures. Our students engage in real-time discussions, submit reflective writing, give feedback on peer work, and participate in global clubs.</p>



<p>Rania Angelis at Rodion Paideia School in Greece notes that students often form friendships through online courses and club activities. As coordinator of the hybrid program with Hudson, she observes that these connections often broaden students’ worldview and help them significantly improve their casual and formal communication skills.</p>



<p>Angelis describes a student who met a Turkish friend through Hudson’s Best Buddy Club. The two teens realised they had more in common than they had expected and formed a strong bond. This summer, the girls will meet in person for the first time. </p>



<p>“This is a friendship that never would have happened in a traditional classroom,” says Angelis. “The student from my school was shy at first, but this helped her come out of her shell and communicate more.”</p>



<p>Cross-cultural connections, such as this, aren’t mere side benefits. They are at the core of learning how to communicate in today’s interconnected world.</p>



<p><strong>Self-management: a must-have in today’s workplace</strong></p>



<p>The modern workday is rarely linear; professionals juggle multiple projects, digital distractions, and global collaboration across time zones. That makes strong time management a professional necessity. Even with AI tools at their fingertips, employees still need the judgment to decide what matters most and when.</p>



<p>Traditional schooling can limit students’ growth in personal time management or mask students’ struggles in this area. Schedules are defined. Teachers remind them of deadlines. In a hybrid program, time management skills are developed and reinforced. If a student doesn’t keep up with classwork, they feel stressed, and their behaviour changes.</p>



<p>“The first year, I left everything until the end, and the last two months were like hell,” says Guillermo. “But I learned from that. Now I plan ahead, stay organised, and really manage my time.”</p>



<p>This isn’t failure – it’s growth. Students in our programs learn to make schedules, prioritise tasks, meet deadlines, and ask for help. They have a teacher from the US who checks in regularly and a local coordinator at their school. But the student is in the driver’s seat – and that’s by design.</p>



<p>We’ve seen this self-management translate to stronger college readiness and more confident transitions to international universities.</p>



<p><strong>Adaptability: the edge that makes a student future-proof</strong></p>



<p>If recent years have taught us anything, it’s that change isn’t a phase – it’s the new normal. Whether it’s emerging technologies, economic shifts, or global events, the pace of change is only accelerating. Today’s students – and tomorrow’s professionals – need the mindset and skills to adapt quickly, stay steady under pressure, and thrive in uncertainty.</p>



<p>Students who can shift gears, learn new tools, and thrive in unfamiliar environments will lead the future workforce. That’s why hybrid education is a powerful training ground for adaptability.</p>



<p>In a hybrid setting, students don’t just learn one way – they engage with a variety of learning tools, including videos, live sessions, interactive tools, and self-paced modules. This variety requires them to adjust to different teaching styles and platforms, often within the same course.</p>



<p>Teachers model flexibility by encouraging experimentation and normalising the idea that learning doesn’t always follow a straight line. Their feedback nudges students to rethink approaches, revise their work, and try again – skills that translate directly to a fast-changing workplace. </p>



<p>“Having teachers who were student-focused in their teaching style was a wonderful help,” says Kevin, a Hudson student from Vietnam. “The independent learning style required by my courses was a different experience for me, but my teachers helped me learn how to study and be more productive and self-directed as a learner.”</p>



<p>Over time, students become more confident navigating the unfamiliar, which is the heart of true adaptability.</p>



<p><strong>From power skills to powerful futures</strong></p>



<p>In a world where job titles barely last a decade, power skills are the constant. Critical thinking, cross-cultural fluency, self-management, and adaptability aren&#8217;t just HR buzzwords – they’re the foundation of lifelong success. These are the skills that help students thrive in college, lead global teams, and navigate the unknown with confidence.</p>



<p>As education leaders, we must ask: Are our programs building the skills students need to thrive in an English-speaking global economy? If not, how can innovative models like hybrid learning help us close the gap?<ins></ins></p>



<p>The answer is clear: hybrid learning doesn’t just teach information. It teaches how to thrive.</p>

Perth International College of English closes due to visa fee hikes

<p>A longstanding pillar of the ELICOS sector, PICE has closed its doors after more than 25 years of service.<br /><br />A notice from The Tuition Protection Service (TPS) confirmed that PICE was placed into liquidation and ceased operating on June 16. The TPS said it is working to assist the international students affected by the closure.</p>



<p>Ian Aird, CEO of <a href="https://www.englishaustralia.com.au/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">English Australia</a>, of which PICE was a member for more than 20 years, commented on the challenging environment faced by ELICOS providers like PICE and the reasons behind its closure.</p>



<p>&#8220;Despite PICE’s exemplary reputation for quality, the <a href="https://thepienews.com/australian-study-visa-hike-slammed/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">increase</a> in the student visa fee to $1,600, the record high student visa application refusal rates over the last 18 months, and the visa application processing delays have meant that PICE were unable to attract enough enrolments to be financially sustainable,&#8221; said Aird.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Aird said that since its founding in 2002, PICE director John Paxton, along with his team of highly dedicated ELICOS professionals, welcomed, served and taught tens of thousands of students from the world over.</p>



<p>For over 12 years, Paxton was a board member of English Australia and the state delegate representing Western Australia’s ELICOS sector.</p>



<p>&#8220;English Australia’s board and secretariat are deeply saddened by this news. John and the PICE team have been integral to our community and our efforts for two decades,&#8221; continued Aird.</p>



<p>English Australia is also working with Paxton and the team, along with the TPS, to support impacted students, with a student information session being held on the PICE campus.</p>



<p>Aird also offered his thoughts to &#8220;all those friends and colleagues across the sector&#8221; who have lost their jobs over recent months and urged stakeholders to reach out to the peak body body, and to one another, to give and get support.&#8221;</p>



<p>The closure follows the shutdown of fellow ELICOS providers <a href="https://thepienews.com/ih-sydney-enters-voluntary-administration/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">IH Sydney</a>, which also put down rising costs of visa fees as contributing factors to its closure.</p>



<p>More recently, The Language Academy, with campuses in Gold Coast and Sydney, <a href="https://thepienews.com/australias-the-language-academy-placed-into-liquidation/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">ceased operations</a> after more than 10 years.</p>



<p>ELICOS stakeholders have previously told <em>The PIE</em> <em>News</em> about the <a href="https://thepienews.com/elicos-sector-blasts-duttons-promise-of-visa-fee-hike/?_thumbnail_id=248869" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">&#8220;immediate and crushing&#8221;</a> impact of the 2024 visa fee increase on the ELICOS sector, with the sector suffering an across the board&nbsp;decline in English language enrolments of 50%.</p>

<p><strong>Introduce yourself in three words or phrases.</strong></p>



<p>Purpose driven, relentless and calm in chaos.</p>



<p><strong>What do you like most about your job?</strong></p>



<p>The constant exposure to new places, people, and cultures keeps me energised. I love being at the intersection of global best practices, high-octane projects, and meaningful impact. Working across borders brings rich diversity, fascinating global team members, and a daily reminder of how much we can learn from each other.</p>



<p><strong>Best work trip/Worst work trip?</strong></p>



<p>My best work trip was to the US in 2017. I made a series of 10 visits to New York that year while working on the acquisition of a major campus site for the Amity Education Group. The adrenaline, the challenge, and the sheer audacity of doing the unthinkable. Every day felt like a bold step forward, and I loved every moment of it.</p>



<p>I have been fortunate that I haven’t had a “worst” trip. Each one has been a learning experience, offering valuable insights and personal growth.</p>



<p><strong>If you could learn a language instantly, which would you pick and why?</strong></p>



<p>If I could instantly learn a language, it would be the one to communicate with animals and birds. I find them incredibly fascinating, and there’s so much wisdom to be gained from them. While I love spending time around them, observing only takes you so far. </p>



<p>They seem to know so much more than us, and it feels like they&#8217;ve cracked the code to living life in the purest form, no fiction, just real connection to the world.</p>



<p>On the business side, I would love to learn Japanese. It’s my latest work crush! The language is deeply intriguing, and its structure and cultural nuances would be a valuable asset.</p>



<p><strong>What makes you get up in the morning?</strong></p>



<p>What gets me up each morning is the drive to create a new impact. Whether it’s helping the team troubleshoot problems, building something new like a project, idea, or process, or simply striving to be better than yesterday, it&#8217;s the constant progress that motivates me. </p>



<p>I push myself to exceed my own expectations, always aiming to evolve and contribute more. Each day brings a new opportunity to make a difference, and that’s what keeps me moving forward.</p>



<p>On top of that, the joy my little daughter Meera brings to my life and the support of my family are constant reminders of why I do what I do!</p>



<p><strong>Champion/cheerleader which we should all follow and why?</strong></p>



<p>The champion I look up to most is Alexander the Great. As a history addict, I’ve always found inspiration in historical figures, and Alexander has been a constant source of motivation for me. What stands out to me is what he achieved at such a young age and how he faced each challenge head-on, making bold moves and pivots to win. </p>



<p>His determination to keep pushing forward, no matter what, is something I deeply resonate with. It reminds me that no matter the circumstances, there’s always a way to make an impact, keep moving, and grow.</p>



<p><strong>Best international ed conference and why</strong></p>



<p>I really enjoyed the <a href="https://thepienews.com/apaie-2025-champions-inclusivity-and-global-citizenship/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">APAIE conference</a> in Delhi, especially because it was held in India. There was something truly special about experiencing one of the largest international education conferences in my own country. It was refreshing to see such a diverse range of countries showing interest in India, particularly from Europe, Latin America, and other regions that I wouldn’t have expected to be discussing their education expertise here. </p>



<p>It was an eye opening experience, and what made it even more memorable was the opportunity to connect with so many new friends and professionals from different backgrounds. It was an inspiring event that highlighted India’s growing influence in the global education landscape.</p>



<p><strong>Worst conference food/beverage experience</strong></p>



<p>I generally don’t eat during conferences, mainly because there’s just no time! But, interestingly enough, I always end up feeling full just by looking at the buffet. It&#8217;s not that funny, but that&#8217;s how it goes. So, I typically just hold a glass in hand and mingle around, meeting new people while avoiding the food altogether!</p>



<p><strong>Book or podcast recommendation for others in the sector?</strong></p>



<p>If I were to recommend a book, <em>Start with Why </em>has been the most impactful for me. It really helped me dig deep into understanding the purpose behind what I do, which has transformed how I lead and connect with my team. It’s all about aligning with a greater purpose, and that has made a world of difference in my approach to work. </p>



<p>The second most impactful read for me was <em>Sapiens</em>. It completely shifts your perspective on life and the world around us. It opens up a new dimension on human history and our evolution, making you think differently about society, culture, and our place in the world. Both books have reshaped how I view leadership and life.</p>



<p><strong>Describe a project or initiative you&#8217;re currently working on that excites you.</strong></p>



<p>On the work front, I am currently diving into a project that excites me on so many levels. A study focused on the internationalisation of Indian higher education. This project is addressing a huge gap for the 98% of Indian students who don’t have the opportunity to study abroad, often due to financial or cultural reasons. </p>



<p>It’s eye opening to realise how international universities have missed out on connecting with these students and how their global needs haven’t been fully recognised. This study is about redefining what international education can mean for them.</p>



<p>On a more personal note, my favorite project is raising my daughter, Meera. It’s been such a joy to show her the world and help her understand the value of life’s small, beautiful moments. I am hoping she’ll grow up with a deep love for animals and photography, the two things I am so passionate about.</p>
