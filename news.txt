Today in crypto, the US House Agriculture Committee approved the Digital Asset Market Clarity bill, advancing the legislation further in Congress. The Bank of Japan's June meeting could trigger a Bitcoin rally if it restarts quantitative easing, and US crypto stocks and Bitcoin rose as more companies add BTC to corporate treasuries.

House Agriculture Committee advances crypto market structure bill

Lawmakers on the US House Agriculture Committee voted in favor of the Digital Asset Market Clarity, or CLARITY, Act, advancing the bill further in Congress.

In a 47-6 vote on Tuesday, an overwhelming majority of lawmakers on the committee approved the CLARITY Act to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets. Committee Chair GT Thompson said the bill would be sent to the House for consideration, adding that any members offering opposing views would have the opportunity to submit them by Friday.

The vote came alongside debate on the House Financial Services Committee discussing an amendment that could add protections for blockchain developers to the CLARITY Act. At the time of publication, the committee had not voted on the bill.

According to its sponsors and co-sponsors, the CLARITY Act is intended to establish clear rules under which digital asset companies can operate in the United States, by also clarifying whether certain investment vehicles fall under the purview of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Consideration of the bill, first introduced in May, comes as the Senate is expected to vote on the GENIUS Act — legislation to regulate payment stablecoins.

Bank of Japan pivot to QE may fuel Bitcoin rally — Arthur Hayes

The Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) upcoming monetary policy meeting in June may provide the next significant catalyst for global risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies.

The BoJ is set to take its next interest rate decision at its upcoming monetary policy meeting on June 16–17.

The central bank may provide the next significant catalyst for Bitcoin (BTC) and other risk assets if it pivots to quantitative easing (QE), according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and chief investment officer of Maelstrom.

“If the BOJ delays QT, and restarts selected QE at its June meeting risk assets are going to fly,” Hayes wrote in a June 10 X post.

QE refers to central banks buying bonds and pumping money into the economy to lower interest rates and encourage spending during difficult financial conditions.

On July 31, 2024, the Bank of Japan introduced a plan to cut government bond purchases by 400 billion yen per quarter, starting in August 2024. The quantitative tightening plan is set for an interim assessment period at the upcoming meeting on June 16, signaling a potential opportunity to pivot.

Bitcoin, US crypto stocks rise as more firms plan BTC buys

US crypto-linked stocks rose alongside Bitcoin to close the Monday trading day at a gain as more publicly traded firms added the asset to their treasuries.

The country’s four biggest crypto miners and some major crypto firms closed at slight gains on June 10, extending gains after-hours.

It comes as Bitcoin (BTC) climbed 4% over the last day to $110,150, heading back toward its May 22 peak of $112,000 as market jitters mostly subsided amid the US and China holding trade talks in the UK.

Crypto and stock trading platform Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) was the rare exception to the broad uptrend, sinking by nearly 2% to $73.40 after S&P Dow Jones Indices didn’t change the S&P 500’s membership on Friday.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining equipment rental firm BitMine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (BMNR),  said on Monday that it bought 100 BTC for the first time to hold in reserve and energy-management firm KULR Technology Group, Inc. (KULR) said on Monday that it bought another $13 million worth of Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 920 Bitcoin.

ETH price tops $2.8K as options traders open bearish positions: Are bears wrong?

https://cointelegraph.com/news/eth-price-tops-2-8k-as-options-traders-open-bearish-positions-are-bears-wrong?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

### 본문
Key takeaways:

Traders are using bearish ETH options to hedge after Ether’s 49% rally in May.

An altcoin ETF listing season could negatively impact ETH’s market dominance and price action.

Ether (ETH) price surged 10% between Monday and Tuesday, reaching its highest level in over 15 weeks. Despite this rally, ETH has consistently struggled to break above the $2,800 mark over the past month. This resistance level has coincided with a growing use of downside protection strategies in ETH derivatives markets.

In addition to standard call (buy) and put (sell) options, traders often use combinations of instruments to design strategies aimed at either maximizing gains above certain levels or reducing exposure to losses. As a result, tracking demand for these options offers insights into how professional traders are positioning themselves.

Traders buy ETH downside risk protection

Open interest in ETH options increased to $8.3 billion from $6.3 billion between early April and Monday, signaling stronger institutional involvement. Deribit remains the dominant exchange, holding a 72% market share. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the flow imbalance between bearish and neutral-to-bullish trades.

One of the most notable strategies traded on Deribit in the past two weeks has been the “short risk reversal.” This setup profits from bearish price moves while collecting a net premium upfront. It involves buying a put and selling a call, hedging against losses below the put strike.

Another popular strategy is the bear diagonal spread, which expresses short-term bearish sentiment in a cost-efficient way. This involves selling a near-term call option and buying a longer-dated call at a higher strike, aiming to benefit from time decay and rising implied volatility.

Ether bulls are optimistic about the June 27 monthly options expiry, especially since call (buy) options account for 63% of total open interest. Currently, 92% of Ether put (sell) options are set at $2,700 or lower, levels that would expire worthless if ETH trades above that mark at expiry.

Some of the market’s caution can be attributed to Ether’s 49% price increase since May, while competitors like Solana (SOL) and XRP gained 8% and 2%, respectively. Traders worry that ETH’s competitive edge could erode if the US Securities and Exchange Commission approves exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for rival altcoins.

Bitcoin continues to drink altcoin’s milkshake

Concerns about Ether’s institutional appeal also emerged after Trump Media and Technology Group, the majority-owned firm of US President Donald Trump, announced a $2.5 billion debt and equity issuance to build a Bitcoin treasury.

Adding to the shift in narrative, Bo Hines, executive director of the White House President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, said on Monday that details about the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve would be shared “in short order,” emphasizing that the “community will be extremely pleased.”

Despite the increased demand for downside protection in ETH options, this doesn’t necessarily imply traders are betting on a price drop. With most June 27 put options targeting levels below $2,700, neutral-to-bullish strategies appear to have the upper hand, offering a supportive backdrop for ETH’s price.

Ethereum Foundation highlights UX, social layer as security ‘challenges’

### 본문
The Ethereum Foundation has highlighted six security challenge areas for its ecosystem’s future in a Tuesday report, including issues with user experience and the social layer.

The analysis, generated through inputs from Ethereum stakeholders like users and developers, notes that user experience, or UX, is one of the key security areas where Ethereum can enhance its position.

“A significant burden of security falls on the user,” notes the report, adding that “UX security and safety was the top issue identified through feedback and consultation with the ecosystem.”

Key aspects of UX concerns include blind signing, approval and permission management, and compromised web interfaces. “Many users are not equipped to safely manage cryptographic keys,” it said.

The report also lists areas such as smart-contract security, infrastructure and cloud security, consensus protocol, monitoring and incident response, along with risk mitigation efforts, social layer and governance.

The analysis highlights the community’s concerns about centralization, including stake centralization and offchain asset centralization. “Centralization of large amounts of stake can pose risks to Ethereum as a whole if the entities controlling that stake decide to collude,” it said. This economic centralization creates the potential for social governance capture.”

The report follows a recently disclosed security endeavor. On May 14, the EF announced its “Trillion Dollar Security Initiative,” appointing  Josh Stark from the Ethereum Foundation management team and Fredrik Svantes, a protocol security research lead, as co-chairs.

According to the Foundation, risks to the social layer and governance “tend to be more long-term oriented, and concern Ethereum as a whole rather than the security of individual users or applications.”

Ethereum leads in DeFi, RWA tokenization

The Ethereum blockchain is still the leading network among decentralized finance applications, despite growing competition across layer-1 blockchains.

Ethereum accounted for $65 billion, or 55.6%, of the $116.9 billion recorded onchain on DeFi protocols as of Tuesday, according to data from DefiLlama. Despite a gradual erosion of market share, Ethereum’s lead remains substantial compared to Solana’s 7.5%.

Ethereum has a similar edge in the RWA tokenization market. The blockchain accounts for $7.35 billion, or 59.6% of the sector’s market. Its nearest competitor, the layer-2 network Stellar, accounts for $465.8 million, or 3.8% of the market.

Franklin Templeton launches &#039;intraday yield&#039; for tokenized assets on Benji

### 본문
Franklin Templeton, an investment management company with $1.53 trillion in assets under management, has debuted a feature that offers investors yield down to the second when holding tokenized assets.

According to a Tuesday announcement, the “Intraday Yield” feature will allow investors to accrue yield proportional to the time they hold a tokenized security, even if it’s transferred before the day’s end. In addition, investors can earn yield on non-banking days, including holidays and weekends.

The feature will be integrated into Franklin Templeton’s tokenization platform Benji. The company said it can potentially improve the crypto industry’s current model of calculating yield over a longer period.

“[…] Intraday Yield is designed to solve a century-old inefficiency in traditional finance: the delayed and rigid nature of yield calculation and distribution,” Roger Bayston, head of Digital Assets at Franklin Templeton, told Cointelegraph.

Yield is calculated at varying intervals depending on the asset class. While it’s typically expressed in annual terms, payouts can be made in scheduled increments. In some cases, higher yields may be tied to holding the asset for a longer period.

“In most legacy systems, yield is only calculated at the end of the trading day and distributed monthly, meaning that investors that transfer or trade during a single session often miss out on the proportional dividend or interest earnings tied to their actual holding time,” Bayston said.

The company is behind one of the largest tokenized treasury funds, with about $750 million in total assets under its Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund.

Demand for asset tokenization climbs in 2025

Tokenizable real-world, yield-bearing assets include debt instruments such as US Treasurys and corporate bonds, as well as equities issued by individual companies. According to RWA.xyz data, the market capitalization of tokenized assets reached $23.14 billion on June 9, up from $15.75 billion in early January, representing a 46.92% increase year to date.

Other asset managers backing tokenized funds include BlackRock and VanEck. Combined, those two companies manage over $2.94 billion in tokenized Treasurys as of June 9.

Funding from crypto falls short in New Jersey gubernatorial primaries

### 링크
https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-funding-new-jersey-gubernatorial-primaries?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

### 본문
As voters head to the ballot boxes to cast their choices for candidates in the Democratic and Republican primaries in New Jersey’s race for its next governor, funds from crypto traders and interest groups don’t seem to be as much of a factor as they were in the 2024 federal races.

According to filings with the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission reviewed by Cointelegraph as of Tuesday, no significant political action committees (PACs) funded by cryptocurrency companies or interest groups appeared to have contributed to any of the 12 Democratic and Republican candidates running for governor.

In a search for contributions directly to candidates or PACs, only a few filings suggested any connections to the crypto industry.

There was a $500 contribution to Democratic candidate Josh Gottheimer’s campaign from mining company MARA Holdings’ vice president of investor relations, Robert Samuels, and a $900 contribution to Republican candidate Jon Bramnick from Rohan Varkey, a strategic finance senior analyst at Block.

In addition, a Coinbase consultant, Miti Sathe, donated $500 to Democratic candidate Steve Fulop, and Roshan Shah, co-founder and CEO of the New Jersey-based mining company Decimal Digital Currency, contributed $2,000 to Democratic candidate Ras Baraka.

The filings for the roughly $4,000 in donations Cointelegraph was able to locate ahead of the Tuesday primaries were paltry compared to the crypto industry’s efforts to support candidates in the 2024 elections, both through direct contributions and media buys through PACs like Fairshake, which spent more than $130 million on congressional races.

Fairshake and its affiliate Protect Progress used more than $450,000 to support Robert Menendez Jr. and Gottheimer in their respective Democratic primaries for US House of Representatives seats in 2024.

Most expensive election in New Jersey history, but without crypto?

Though seemingly not as financially involved in the New Jersey gubernatorial race, the crypto advocacy group Stand With Crypto, affiliated with Coinbase, organized a “get out the vote” rally on Thursday, allowing three candidates for the governorship to speak to crypto-minded residents. Gottheimer, Fulop and Republican candidate Bill Spadea expressed views that were supportive of digital assets at the event.

A spokesperson for Stand With Crypto told Cointelegraph after the event that the organization’s PAC had not yet used any of its funds to support candidates in the state’s gubernatorial election. Cointelegraph reached out to representatives of Coinbase and Fairshake but had not received responses at the time of publication.

According to a June 4 report from AdImpact, the gubernatorial primary was set to become the most expensive election in the state’s history, with more than $85 million spent to support or oppose candidates. Data showed PACs and interest groups spent more than $22 million on Gottheimer’s campaign, though the report did not mention funding from crypto companies.

Lawmakers on the US House Agriculture Committee voted in favor of the Digital Asset Market Clarity, or CLARITY, Act, advancing the bill further in Congress.

In a 47-6 vote on Tuesday, an overwhelming majority of lawmakers on the committee approved the CLARITY Act to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets. Committee Chair GT Thompson said the bill would be sent to the House for consideration, adding that any members offering opposing views would have the opportunity to submit them by Friday.

The vote came alongside debate on the House Financial Services Committee discussing an amendment that could add protections for blockchain developers to the CLARITY Act. At the time of publication, the committee had not voted on the bill.

According to its sponsors and co-sponsors, the CLARITY Act is intended to establish clear rules under which digital asset companies can operate in the United States, by also clarifying whether certain investment vehicles fall under the purview of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Consideration of the bill, first introduced in May, comes as the Senate is expected to vote on the GENIUS Act — legislation to regulate payment stablecoins.

Another committee debates amendments to the CLARITY Act

House Financial Services Committee members spent much of a Tuesday markup hearing debating the merits of amendments to the CLARITY Act. Ranking member Maxine Waters proposed amending the crypto market structure to address allegations of conflicts of interest related to US President Donald Trump’s crypto businesses, including using the bill to personally enrich himself and his family, while Representative Brad Sherman proposed another amendment at the event to prohibit what he called potential “bailouts” of the crypto industry in the future.

“The purpose of [the CLARITY Act] is to build a superhighway to crypto becoming so significant that it poses a systemic risk, and then make sure that every Republican member of this committee can say they’re against bailouts but find an excuse not to prohibit bailouts but to leave in [provisions] that will allow for the bailouts,” said Sherman.

Committee Chair French Hill, who proposed the amendment that could ​​add protections for blockchain developers to the bill, said the legislation “...was not about bailouts, it was about consistency.” According to the Arkansas representative, the CLARITY Act would address “...when is a digital asset considered a security under the oversight of the [SEC] or a non-security or digital commodity under the authority of the [CFTC]” and change the US regulatory approach to crypto.

Other lawmakers sparred on events surrounding the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX in 2022 and how regulators responded at the time. Neither Waters’ nor Sherman’s amendments passed the committee in a voice vote. At the time of publication, the committee members had not voted on Hill’s amendment.

https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-fair-value-could-be-as-high-as-230k-bitwise-analysts?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

### 본문
Key takeaways:

Bitwise predicts Bitcoin could hit $200,000 by year-end, with a potential “fair value” of $230,000.

Trump’s proposed tax cuts and rising US debt position Bitcoin as a hedge against sovereign default risks.

Bitcoin’s OTT signal suggests strong momentum after a dip to $100,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) could surpass $200,000 by the end of the year and eventually reach its estimated “fair value” of $230,000, according to Bitwise researchers André Dragosch and Ayush Tripathi.

Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” is bullish for Bitcoin

In their weekly crypto outlook, Dragosch and Tripathi cite the US’s soaring federal debt and mandatory spending exceeding revenue, exacerbated by Trump’s proposed “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” tax cuts, as key drivers of their bullish Bitcoin prediction.

The Congressional Budget Office forecasts net interest payments tripling to $3 trillion by 2030, raising default fears.

“Bitcoin’s scarcity and resilience position it uniquely to benefit from both fiscal instability and improving market sentiment,” Bitwise analysts said. If these trends hold, the top crypto could shatter price expectations by year-end.

Related: Bank of Japan pivot to QE may fuel Bitcoin rally — Arthur Hayes

An example of such “sovereign stress” is Bitcoin’s performance in the wake of the Donald Trump-Elon Musk feud last week, driven by the latter’s criticism of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

BTC’s price declined 6% to almost $100,000 amid the spat, only to recover sharply over the weekend.

“Despite a short-lived dip to $100K during the Musk-Trump spat, BTC quickly rebounded on short liquidations,” wrote Bitwise, adding:

“The [bullish] backdrop remains constructive.”

Consensus builds on $200,000 BTC price target

Adding to Bitwise’s outlook, a May 28 analysis by Stockmoney Lizards highlights a bullish Bitcoin breakout indicator.

The signal comes from the Optimized Trend Tracker (OTT), which triggered for the first time since mid-2024, suggesting Bitcoin will potentially reach $200,000 in 2025, with a possible extension to $250,000.

Last month, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan told Cointelegraph that the BTC price will hit $200,000 by the end of 2025, driven by a supply shock from surging institutional demand.

A “power law” model that has accurately called Bitcoin tops and bottoms in the past cycles further hints at BTC price hitting $200,000 by year’s end.

How to use Grok for real-time crypto trading signals

https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-use-grok-for-crypto-trading?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

### 본문
Key takeaways

Grok scans real-time sentiment on X to detect early crypto trends, including meme coin momentum and macro reactions.

Traders have used Grok-style setups to track tokens like TURBO, ORDI and FET before price moves occurred.

Unlike chart-based tools, Grok captures emotional tone and crowd narrative shifts across thousands of posts.

When paired with ChatGPT, Grok helps surface signals, while ChatGPT assists in strategy design and automation logic.

While useful for sentiment parsing, Grok doesn’t execute trades, interpret charts or manage risk — it works best as a signal assistant.

Why Grok is getting attention from crypto traders

Many retail traders still rely on news alerts, influencer posts or Discord trading groups to stay ahead of the market. While these sources can offer signals, they’re often delayed or shaped by social bias. In fast-moving crypto environments, that delay can mean missing the window to act.

Grok, the conversational AI developed by Elon Musk’s xAI and embedded into X, is being explored by some traders as a way to monitor sentiment shifts more efficiently. Unlike traditional tools, Grok has direct access to live X data, enabling it to interpret real-time conversations, track trending token mentions, and detect early signs of narrative movement.

Some developers are testing Grok in conjunction with other AI tools to surface high-frequency mentions or emotional keywords tied to memecoins and altcoins. One post in a crypto dev forum describes an experimental setup where Grok flagged repeated FLOKI mentions from verified users shortly before a price move. While still experimental, these use cases show how sentiment parsing on X can inform short-term trading decisions.

Instead of acting as a trading strategy on its own, Grok is being used as a tool to enhance awareness of market mood, especially for assets driven more by social engagement than fundamentals.

What is Grok?

Grok is a conversational AI model developed by xAI, Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company. It is currently available to X Premium+ users, where it integrates with the X platform to provide direct access to trending content and public conversations in real time.

Unlike traditional AI assistants like ChatGPT, which rely on processed or external data feeds, Grok can tap into live user discussions, sentiment flows and viral trends as they unfold. This makes it particularly useful for tracking crypto sentiment, especially for assets that react to narrative momentum, including memecoins, altcoins and even Bitcoin (BTC) during key macroeconomic events.

Why Grok matters for crypto traders

Let’s break it down with a real-world scenario:

On March 13, 2024, Musk posted a meme featuring Pepe the Frog. Shortly afterward, the price of the Pepe (PEPE) cryptocurrency jumped by 12.2%, breaking the $0.000009 mark. While this timing drew attention, it’s important to note that correlation doesn’t imply causation. The price movement may have been influenced by broader memecoin activity, technical setups or other social factors, not just the meme post itself.

By the time the news reached Telegram groups and aggregators, the entry window had already passed.

Now imagine Grok:

Reading that influencer’s post instantly

Parsing community replies to determine sentiment polarity

Matching it to previous patterns of similar pump setups

Triggering a “high social spike” alert for meme coins.

Traders have begun experimenting with Grok for sentiment-driven trading setups by connecting it to real-time X data via unofficial APIs or scraping tools. Spikes were defined as a 5x increase in token mentions over a four-hour period across verified or high-engagement accounts, while hints included repeated mentions of partnership rumors, macro triggers or keyword anomalies like “rate cut” or “whale buy” linked to specific tokens.

How to use Grok for sentiment, signals and macro insights

If you’ve traded crypto during a meme cycle, you know how fast sentiment shifts and how slow most tools are to pick it up. Grok changes that. Thanks to its direct integration with X, it can scan thousands of posts, hashtags and comment threads as they happen. When used strategically, Grok becomes a tool not just for reading sentiment but for trading it.

Here’s how crypto traders are starting to use Grok in practical ways.

Sentiment monitoring in real time

Grok actively scans crypto posts on X for market-moving phrases and sentiment anomalies, such as “floor is in,” “massive unlock,” “whale dump” or “rate cut confirmed.” It goes beyond surface-level mentions to decode context, emotional tone and intent in each post.

By leveraging X’s API, some traders are experimenting with Grok to:

Track early sentiment in lesser-known tokens before price action begins: In April 2024, mentions of TURBO increased across X, driven by developer discussions and previews of upcoming features. This shift preceded a 22% price rally roughly 36 hours later, suggesting sentiment tools can expose momentum ahead of chart-based signals.

Gauge emotional volatility around macro news events: During the March 2024 US Federal Open Market Committee update, Grok-powered setups flagged rising anxiety around BTC. Traders noted that crowd sentiment turned negative before the actual dip occurred, helping some adjust positioning earlier than usual.

Spot sentiment divergence, where engagement rises but price lags (or vice versa): In February 2024, community chatter around FET spiked, while the price remained flat. Some early traders used this mismatch as an entry cue, preceding a breakout two days later.

Unlike traditional keyword scanners, Grok applies deep sentiment parsing and real-time X integration, capturing nuance during high-impact events like Consumer Price Index (CPI) drops, exchange-traded fund (ETF) rumors or influencer U-turns.

Below is an example output from a custom sentiment parser built using Grok’s access to X, analyzing 12 posts about Bitcoin (BTC) in a six-hour window. The data set included posts from high-profile accounts like Whale Alert and Michael Saylor, as well as smaller influencers commenting on BTC leverage, short-term trading and macro comparisons. The goal was to measure the emotional and directional tone of real-time crypto sentiment during a volatile trading session.

X feed signal parsing

Thanks to its integration with X, Grok can detect momentum the moment certain content begins trending. Traders experimenting with Grok-like setups use it to:

Track token mentions gaining traction, such as sudden increases in usage of a specific ticker (e.g., “$FET” or “$TURBO”) across multiple verified or active accounts within a short window.

Monitor influencer activity tied to specific tokens, such as when a high-following account hints at a listing, partnership or price outlook, especially when combined with above-average engagement like repost surges or rapid reply chains.

For example, during a 24-hour window in February 2024, the number of posts mentioning “$ORDI” jumped to over 400 from under 50, led by influential traders discussing potential listings. Grok-style sentiment tools flagged this spike in narrative velocity well before price reflected the attention.

By analyzing these types of real-time social signals, Grok enables users to spot early momentum shifts across crypto communities. This allows traders to evaluate developing narratives while they’re still taking shape rather than reacting after they hit aggregator sites or news feeds.

Macro awareness for high-timeframe trades

Grok AI enables traders to track real-time sentiment around macroeconomic events like CPI releases, interest rate decisions and crypto regulations.

For example, following the December 2024 US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which showed an annual inflation rate of 2.9%, Bitcoin briefly crossed $98,500. This movement aligned with market expectations and was interpreted by some analysts as a bullish signal for risk assets, reflecting optimism about potential Federal Reserve rate cuts.

By parsing crowd-level data in real time, Grok often provides a clearer picture of market positioning than traditional headlines. This insight can help traders time capital rotations between BTC, stablecoins or altcoins more effectively, especially when market sentiment shifts rapidly post-macro events.

Grok vs. ChatGPT for crypto trading

Grok and ChatGPT are both AI tools being explored for crypto analysis, but they serve different functions. For traders, analysts or researchers looking to improve decision-making, understanding where each tool fits can help streamline different parts of the workflow.

Grok is integrated with X and is available to X Premium+ users. Its key strength is real-time sentiment parsing. It can track public posts, monitor trending discussions, and flag early signals based on community chatter. This makes it useful for identifying potential momentum shifts tied to market narratives, token mentions or macroeconomic events.

ChatGPT, on the other hand, is more effective for structured analysis. It doesn’t access live social feeds unless connected to APIs or plugins. However, it can explain trading strategies, summarize research and interpret technical indicators based on user inputs. This makes it suitable for backtesting concepts, understanding token mechanics or generating trade logic for bots.

Developers in AI trading communities often pair both tools — using Grok to identify emerging trends from real-time sentiment and ChatGPT to refine strategies, simulate scenarios, or build automation logic around those signals.

Data access: Real-time vs. processed knowledge

Grok has a major advantage when it comes to real-time information. Because it’s embedded directly into X, Grok can scan live posts, community reactions and trending content as it happens. That makes it incredibly useful for:

Capturing sudden sentiment shifts

Spotting viral token mentions before price moves

Reacting to breaking macro or regulatory news.

ChatGPT, on the other hand, doesn’t have live feed access unless you connect it to external tools (like a browser plugin or API). Its strength lies in structured analysis, explaining trading strategies, running conceptual backtests or summarizing white papers.

If you need fast input from the crypto crowd, Grok wins.

If you need structured insight or technical breakdowns, ChatGPT is your tool.

Sentiment vs. strategy

Grok is particularly effective at analyzing real-time social narratives across crypto communities. It’s ideal for:

Crypto sentiment from X

Identifying early crypto signals from trending posts and community chatter

Identifying memecoin rotations and community-driven pumps

Gauging macro reaction in real time.

ChatGPT is more effective for:

Writing or debugging trading bots

Explaining concepts like liquidation cascades or funding rates

Developing AI-powered crypto trading strategies.

For example, the AI4Crypto GitHub repo includes scripts integrating Grok sentiment with backtesting logic via ChatGPT. These experimental setups are becoming more common in open-source quant groups, while ChatGPT is used to draft trading logic or simulate responses. These paired setups are becoming more common in open-source quant groups and AI-based trading experiments.

Grok is designed to be reactive. It detects signals the moment they start trending. This has led developers in the crypto automation space to experiment with building auto-trading alerts that respond to Grok-identified sentiment spikes.

ChatGPT, by contrast, requires more setup. Unless integrated with real-time APIs, it works best with questions grounded in historical or static data.

That’s not a flaw — it’s intentional. Grok acts as a market listener; ChatGPT functions as a strategy explainer.

Risks, limitations and what Grok can’t do for crypto traders

As promising as Grok is, it’s important to understand its boundaries. Traders experimenting with AI often run into issues not because the tool is bad, but because they expect it to do everything.

Grok can enhance your workflow, but it’s not a plug-and-play magic signal generator.

No trade execution logic

Unlike a crypto bot connected to an exchange, Grok doesn’t execute trades or manage positions. It can alert you to rising sentiment or narrative shifts, but it won’t know whether your strategy is risk-on or risk-off.

Some traders are building Grok-connected scripts for trade alerts, but these setups still require manual review or pairing with third-party execution platforms.

Bottom line: Grok is a signal scout, not a full-stack trading engine.

No charting or technical indicator awareness

Grok 3 has introduced early-stage support for parsing some market data and basic chart patterns, but it still lacks full technical analysis (TA) capabilities. For precise TA, traders should still rely on tools like TradingView or dedicated bots. That’s a major difference from tools like ChatGPT, which can explain and simulate trading strategies using TA logic.

So, while Grok might tell you, “SHIBA is trending,” it won’t say, “This is a bullish flag on the 4H.” For that, you’ll still need TradingView, CoinGlass or a hybrid AI setup.

Susceptible to noise and manipulation

Because Grok pulls directly from X, it’s reading unfiltered public data, which can include misinformation, coordinated shilling or sentiment spoofing.

During memecoin cycles, it’s common for groups to artificially inflate mentions, hype or fake news. If Grok is used without filtering or human context, it might flag these as bullish signals when they’re just exit liquidity traps.

This is one of the biggest risks of trading with Grok AI: You’re relying on the crowd’s words, not the market’s confirmations.

Limited depth on altcoins

While Grok is strong at identifying trending topics, it struggles when sentiment data is thin. For smaller altcoins with low visibility or limited community discussion, Grok may return weak or irrelevant signals.

Traders using Grok for niche decentralized finance (DeFi) or microcap tokens may get better results by pairing it with crypto technical analysis software or onchain tools like Nansen.

No built-in risk management

Grok doesn’t know your portfolio size, stop-loss level or risk tolerance. It won’t warn you that you’re overexposed, chasing pumps or trading against a trend.

This is where most new traders overestimate AI. AI-powered crypto trading strategies still require a human layer of risk control. Grok might tell you what’s hot, but it’s your job to decide if it’s worth chasing.

Ethereum network growth, spot ETH ETF inflows and price gains lure new investors

### 본문
Key takeaways:

ETH’s price gains are driven by an uptick in network activity and robust spot ETF inflows.

Data suggests $2,800 will remain a difficult hurdle for ETH to overcome.

Ether (ETH) has traded within a relatively narrow range between $2,370 and $2,770 since May 10, yet several indicators suggest potential for upward movement. Ethereum continues to lead the blockchain space in both deposits and activity when its layer-2 scaling solutions are included in the analysis.

Despite Ether's failure to reclaim its all-time high during the 2024–25 cycle, none of the so-called Ethereum killers have come close to matching its $66.6 billion in total value locked (TVL). Ethereum currently holds a dominant 61% share of the market, while the two largest competitors together account for only 14%.

The TVL of Ethereum’s base layer grew 6% over the past 30 days, led by gains from Pendle, Ethena, and Spark. In contrast, BNB Chain saw a 6% decline, and Solana’s deposits dropped by 2%. More importantly, the surge in deposits across competing blockchains during the memecoin frenzy earlier in 2025 has proven to be unsustainable.

Ethereum did lose ground in decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes due to high base layer fees, which remain a barrier for most users. However, its layer-2 solutions collectively recorded an impressive $70 billion in DEX activity over 30 days, maintaining Ethereum’s lead across the ecosystem. Notable contributors include Base, Arbitrum, Unichain, and Polygon.

Interestingly, some networks that once aimed to challenge Ethereum’s dominance with base-layer scalability are now absent from the top six in DEX activity. For example, Tron reportedly posted just $4.5 billion in 30-day volume, while Avalanche recorded $4.2 billion. By contrast, Ethereum and its scaling solutions totaled $136.8 billion.

Critics of Ether have raised concerns about Ethereum’s sustainability, pointing to its modest $43.3 million in chain fees over 30 days. Recent network updates have prioritized benefits for rollups, introducing large, low-cost temporary data packets known as blobs. As a result, returns for stakers have been negatively impacted, since ETH’s supply reduction largely depends on network fees.

Beyond its onchain dominance, Ether remains the only altcoin with approved spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. This advantage has helped solidify a $10 billion market, while competitors like Solana and XRP still await decisions from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Analysts expect a final ruling by mid-October.

Since May 16, the spot ETH ETFs have not recorded a single day of net outflows, amassing $837 million in net inflows during the period. While this buying pressure may appear modest compared to the $4 billion in average daily ETH volume on major exchanges, it signals growing institutional interest.

Related: Everyone loves crypto ETFs, but not after reading the fine print

Ether’s short-term supply, as measured by exchange deposits, has fallen to a record low near 16.33 million ETH. Simultaneously, 28.3% of the total Ether supply is now locked in staking, a dynamic that supports positive price moves when demand increases.

The sharp 48% ETH rally between May 7 and May 14 underscores the imbalance between holders and potential buyers. Considering Ethereum’s onchain metrics and rising spot ETF demand, a breakout above $2,800 in the near term seems likely.

Meta’s AI shortfall prompts Zuckerberg’s $15B investment in Scale AI — Report

https://cointelegraph.com/news/meta-acquires-49-percent-scale-ai-big-tech-ai-race?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

### 본문
Meta Platforms is reportedly acquiring a 49% stake in Scale AI, a leading data labeling company that powers many AI applications, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg seeks to strengthen Meta’s position in the competitive artificial intelligence landscape.

After days of speculation, The Information reported on Tuesday that Meta has finalized a $14.8 billion deal for a significant minority share in Scale AI.

According to sources familiar with the negotiations, the transaction was completed in cash and includes Scale AI’s CEO, Alexandr Wang, joining Meta as part of a new “Superintelligence” initiative.

Bloomberg reported on Monday that Zuckerberg has grown frustrated with Meta’s progress in AI and is assembling a large team to pursue artificial general intelligence — a future form of AI that could match or surpass human cognitive abilities.

Ben Goertzel, a computer scientist and founder of SingularityNET, an AI decentralized ecosystem, says major breakthroughs in AGI could be a few years away.

“We’re likely to be able to launch AGI that can think and generalize beyond its training and programming within the next one to three years,” he told Cointelegraph in a recent interview.

Goertzel says decentralization offers the best path for safeguarding the future of AGI.

In the meantime, Big Tech firms are intensifying their efforts to be among the first to achieve this potentially transformative milestone.

Big Tech’s AI spending grows

America’s largest technology companies — including Meta, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft — are expected to invest $320 billion in AI and related data center infrastructure this year alone, according to CNBC. That represents a sharp increase from the $230 billion invested last year.

A separate analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence’s Robert Schiffman found that AI capital expenditures have increased by 16% since the start of 2025.

As AI spending continues to grow, companies involved in building the underlying infrastructure are well-positioned to benefit.

Goldman Sachs analyzed a basket of stocks in the AI data center and electrical equipment sectors and found they have risen 52% and 39%, respectively, since their April lows.

### 본문
US investment manager Guggenheim is expanding its digital commercial paper offering through a partnership with Ripple, underscoring the growing convergence between traditional finance and crypto-native enterprises.

Under the partnership, Guggenheim’s subsidiary, Guggenheim Treasury Services, will make its US Treasury-backed fixed-income asset available on the XRP Ledger, according to Bloomberg. Ripple will invest $10 million in the asset as part of the collaboration.

The commercial paper product is fully backed by US Treasurys with customized maturity options of up to 397 days.

RippleX executive Markus Infanger told Bloomberg that the product could also be made available for purchase using Ripple’s US dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD. Since its launch in December, RLUSD’s circulating supply has surpassed $350 million.

The Ripple partnership isn’t Guggenheim’s first foray into the cryptocurrency sector. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Guggenheim tokenized its $20 million commercial paper offering on the Ethereum blockchain in September 2024.

Wall Street eyes RWA tokenization

Tokenization is rapidly gaining momentum on Wall Street, as leading financial institutions recognize the benefits of enabling real-world assets (RWAs) to be traded onchain.

Among the most notable trends is the tokenization of money market funds, exemplified by BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), Franklin Templeton’s OnChain US Government Money Fund, and Fidelity’s tokenized US dollar money market fund.

Crypto-native companies are also broadening access to tokenized assets for a wider investor base.

As Cointelegraph reported, German tokenization protocol Midas recently launched a tokenized Treasury bill on the Algorand blockchain. Unlike BUIDL, which requires a minimum investment of $5 million, Midas’ product has no investment minimums, making it accessible to more investors.

Meanwhile, blockchain-focused venture firm Jump Crypto recently made an undisclosed investment into Securitize, the tokenization platform behind BlackRock’s BUIDL.

Securitize has accumulated more than $4 billion in onchain assets, with BUIDL accounting for nearly $3 billion.

https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-traders-see-107k-retest-before-new-all-time-highs?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

### 본문
Key points:

Bitcoin is due a fresh run at all-time highs, traders believe, but a corrective phase is due first.

BTC price targets include $107,000, with the six-figure barrier still on the table.

US inflation data will inform market performance for the rest of the week.

Bitcoin (BTC) sold off at the June 10 Wall Street open as traders took profit on a run past $110,000.

Bitcoin all-time high talk returns after $110,000 tap

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD circling the $108,500 mark at the time of writing, down around 1.5% from the daily open.

Excitement over potential progress in a trade deal between the US and China had stoked crypto upside overnight, with the second day of talks still ongoing.

“Despite vague affirmations from US officials, with terms like ‘fruitful’ and ‘good meeting’ dominating the post-talks rhetoric, the absence of substantive breakthroughs saw global risk assets pause,” trading firm QCP summarized in part of its latest bulletin to Telegram channel subscribers on the day.

Digesting the latest market performance, crypto commentators agreed that a brief consolidation period should come next.

“The first period of consolidation typically lasts a few days. Then, we're going to have the next breakout above the ATH,” trader, analyst and entrepreneur Michaël van de Poppe wrote in part of his latest analysis on X.

“Ideal zone to buy? I would estimate around $107,000-$ 108,000.”

Analyst Mark Cullen also flagged $107,000 as a possible dip zone as part of a “quick retrace and fast buy up” for Bitcoin next.

Other scenarios included a second retest of $100,000 support, as well as a $98,000 target in the case of a deeper correction.

“Key levels are 106K, then 98K for bullish continuation into the summer,” Cullen concluded.

Markets “remain in limbo” before CPI

Continuing, QCP noted the imminent slew of US macroeconomic data prints, these including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) reports for May on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.

“For now, markets remain in limbo,” it argued.

“With US CPI data scheduled for release tomorrow, investors are treading cautiously. The risk is that continued diplomatic ambiguity morphs into a headwind for broader risk sentiment.”

As Cointelegraph reported, the data will form some of the final US inflation cues before the Federal Reserve meets to discuss interest rates on June 18.

Markets see little chance of a rate cut before September, while US President Donald Trump has repeatedly demanded that Fed action be brought forward.

The results of a poll of economists by Reuters released on the day reiterated expectations of a Q3 rate-cut resumption.

The NFT market is silently becoming infrastructure

### 링크
https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-becoming-infrastructure?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

### 본문
Opinion by: Charu Sethi, president of Unique Network

Some argue that NFTs are dead. Others are holding out for the speculative art boom to return with the next market cycle. Both assumptions miss the reality. NFTs are neither obsolete nor poised for another speculative hype wave. What’s unfolding instead is likely the most important phase in their evolution: where NFTs are transitioning into core digital infrastructure underpinning gaming, AI and machine-driven applications.

The market has evolved

There are clear signs that NFT utility is replacing speculation, and the trend is holding. According to DappRadar, in Q1 2025, NFT trading volume dropped 24%, but sales declined only by 10%, pointing to lower average prices rather than user exit. AI and social DApps — with the potential to leverage NFTs for agent identity, assets, credentials and access — grew sharply in Q1, and utility categories like real-world assets (RWAs), domain NFTs and metaverse assets showed sustained traction.

In gaming, platforms like Mythical and The Sandbox continue to grow, where in-game assets provide real, functional value. While there is still a vision and demand for interoperable NFTs, there are also examples where they are being delivered for developers and end-users.

NFTs in the agentic AI era

NFTs were originally conceived to enable verifiable digital ownership, identity and programmable rights — not speculative trading. It was meant to give people ownership of their digital lives. Be it their identity, health records, social media content or creative work — NFTs offered a way to prove ownership. That vision was foundational to the broader Web3 movement.

This foundational vision was obscured by the rise of memecoins and short-term financial hype, distorting public perception of NFTs and Web3. This core utility resurfaces as the agentic AI era emerges, where code meets cognition. Autonomous AI agents now require self-sovereign identity, memory and access control to operate effectively onchain.

With AI frameworks maturing, NFTs are becoming embedded as infrastructure. They function as identity anchors, verifiable data containers and access credentials for agents acting across decentralized environments. An NFT-bound agent can independently access services, sign transactions, and trigger contract logic — its authority validated by the NFT. This transforms NFTs into operational components that persist across contexts.

Recent: Crypto, NFTs are a lifeboat in the sinking fiat system: Finance Redefined

This utility is already in production. ReinforcedAI’s subnet on Bittensor issues NFTs as proof of completed Solidity audits, enabling encrypted validator review and decentralized reward mechanisms. Similarly, NFTs are used to certify input-output processes across AI pipelines. In parallel, projects like Peaq use “machine NFTs” to give devices like vehicles and drones identity and autonomy to transact. As AI agents integrate further into Web3 systems, NFTs will underpin workflows ranging from personal AI wallets to non-fungible autonomous agents.

UX-driven wallets and mainstream entry

The growth of social wallets is another driver. Instead of complex key management, users onboard through email or social login, and their profile pics, memberships and credentials (silently NFTs) display as part of their Web3 identity. Over 50% of users aged 18-34 already use social wallets regularly, especially in gaming and community apps.

These wallets prioritize user experience and easily embed NFTs into familiar interfaces. In social gaming platforms, for example, players may not even realize their avatars, emotes or achievements are NFTs. Yet these assets are portable, tradable and interoperable — acting as the connective tissue across platforms. There are significant lessons learned about how true ownership and great UX are critical for SocialFi apps to succeed.

NFTs as invisible infrastructure

NFTs are not disappearing — they are becoming core infrastructure, functioning as the underlying layer for asset ownership, transactional logic and autonomous agent behavior in decentralized systems. They support player-owned economies in gaming, serve as identity and credential containers for AI agents, and enable payments and access rights in machine-to-machine networks. This reflects a broader architectural shift from front-end collectibles to back-end components embedded in wallets, SDKs and protocols. NFTs now power access control, data provenance and interoperability, redefining their role from visible assets to essential system primitives.

Waiting for the return of the speculative NFT boom as a measure of success is misguided — real progress is unfolding at the infrastructure layer, where NFTs are quietly becoming essential.

Why crypto is a prime target

Crypto transactions are fast, irreversible and often anonymous, making them ideal for scammers. Once a transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, there’s no getting it back. That makes crypto especially attractive to hackers. Many users also store their funds in hot wallets connected to browsers or apps, which are more vulnerable to phishing attempts.

Add to that the growing popularity of NFTs and DeFi projects and there is more possibility for attacks. Approving the wrong contract, even once, can be all it takes to lose everything in your wallet.

Did you know? In March 2025, the official X accounts of both the NBA and NASCAR were hacked, sending fake messages to millions of their followers. These messages falsely announced the launch of their own cryptocurrencies, $NBA coin and $NASCAR coin.

Real-world examples of crypto scams via fake X links

These aren’t hypothetical. Hackers have already pulled off some high-profile attacks using fake X links.1. WIRED journalist’s X account hijacked (May 2025)In May 2025, a WIRED journalist disclosed that his X account was compromised and used to promote a fraudulent WIRED cryptocurrency via memecoin launchpad Pump.fun. The attackers created the coin and initiated a pump-and-dump scheme, manipulating the price with deceptive promotions before quickly selling off their holdings. As a result, many investors lost money and the journalist became the target of harassment, including racist and threatening messages, especially from an anonymous Telegram user who demanded a refund of $2,800. Analysis from Chainalysis and Hudson Intelligence revealed that the attackers controlled about 12% of the coin and made an estimated $8,000–$10,000 in under 20 minutes. The funds were laundered through various crypto wallets and eventually deposited into Binance, where the trail ended. The journalist had failed to secure their account with two-factor authentication, which facilitated the hack. Despite the risks and frequent scams, trading in memecoins continues to be popular, underscoring the ongoing vulnerabilities in social media and cryptocurrency platforms.2. Pump.fun X account compromised (February 2025)In February 2025, the official X account of Pump.fun, a Solana-based memecoin generator, was hijacked to promote a fraudulent governance token called “PUMP.” Shortly after the initial scam post, the hackers escalated their efforts by promoting another fake token, “GPT-4.5,” while threatening to delete the Pump.fun X account if the token reached a $100 million market cap, further adding to the chaos and confusion among users. Pump.fun quickly acknowledged the breach on its Telegram channel, urging users not to engage with the compromised X account. This incident highlights how even platforms dedicated to memecoins can become targets for sophisticated scams.3. Lara and Tiffany Trump’s X accounts breached (September 2024)In September 2024, hackers breached the X accounts of Lara and Tiffany Trump, posting fraudulent content promoting a family cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial. Eric Trump declared the posts a scam, confirming the compromise on X and the swift deletion of the fake posts. The incident was notable given President Donald Trump’s relationship with Elon Musk, who owns X. The family had been promoting World Liberty Financial, which had yet to launch and had already been targeted by scams. An official World Liberty Financial account warned users to avoid any links or token purchases from the compromised profiles.These examples underscore the importance of vigilance when encountering cryptocurrency promotions on social media platforms.

How to spot a fake X link

Fake links often look real, but a closer look usually reveals red flags. Being aware of the small details can help you avoid costly mistakes.If you’re scrolling through X and come across a post promoting a new token, an exclusive airdrop or a link to “connect your wallet,” take a moment before clicking. These kinds of posts are common tools in phishing scams, and spotting them often comes down to examining the link and the context closely.Here are a few things you can look for:1. Check the URL carefullyBefore you click, hover over the link (if you’re on desktop) or tap and hold to preview it on mobile. Look for small changes like:Misspelled words (for example, Binancee.com instead of Binance.com)Strange characters or extra symbolsUnfamiliar domain endings like .click, .lol, or .xyzIf something feels off, it probably is.2. Watch for urgent or emotional languageScam posts often try to pressure you. You might see phrases like:“Only 30 minutes left!”“Claim your free tokens now!”“Exclusive to early supporters!”This urgency is designed to get you to act before you think. Real companies don’t rush you into financial decisions.3. Look at the account behind the postEven if the post looks professional, take a moment to inspect the account:Is the username slightly different from an authentic brand or influencer?Does the account have a verified badge, or is it paid for?Are the past posts consistent and legitimate, or does the account suddenly start posting about crypto?Scammers often use newly created or recently hacked accounts to spread malicious links. For instance, in December 2024, Scam Sniffer notified users of a sharp rise in fake crypto accounts on X, warning that over 300 impersonator profiles appeared daily, nearly double the November average.4. Notice engagement patternsAre the replies filled with suspicious comments, fake praise, or bot activity? Scammers sometimes flood the comments with bots saying, “This worked!” or “Thanks, I just got my airdrop!” These are meant to build false trust.5. Double-check before you connectIf a link takes you to a wallet connection page, double-check the website address. Fake wallet popups are one of the most effective tricks used to steal your crypto. Always make sure you’re on the official site, not a lookalike.Did you know? A single victim lost $2.6 million in stablecoins after falling for two zero-value transfer phishing scams within just three hours, highlighting the growing threat of address poisoning in crypto.

If a link takes you to a wallet connection page, double-check the website address. Fake wallet popups are one of the most effective tricks used to steal your crypto. Always make sure you’re on the official site, not a lookalike.

Did you know? A single victim lost $2.6 million in stablecoins after falling for two zero-value transfer phishing scams within just three hours, highlighting the growing threat of address poisoning in crypto.

How to protect yourself on X

X is a powerful platform for staying informed about crypto, but it’s also a favorite target for scammers. Knowing how to protect your account and your assets can save you from serious losses.You don’t need to avoid X entirely to stay safe. But if you’re active in crypto circles, you should treat the platform with the same caution you would observe in a crowded marketplace. Be cautious: Scammers often use urgency and fake credibility to trick you into clicking malicious links or connecting your wallet.Check URLs: Always hover over links to preview them. Watch for subtle misspellings or suspicious domain endings like .xyz, .click or .site.Verify accounts: Even verified profiles can be hacked. Look at post history, engagement quality and account behavior before trusting promotions.Use 2FA: Enable two-factor authentication with an app like Google Authenticator or Authy to add a second layer of protection.Avoid DMs: Treat unsolicited messages promoting crypto projects or asking you to click links as suspicious, especially if they ask for wallet access.Separate your wallets: Use one wallet for active interactions (airdrops, mints, trading) and another for long-term storage to limit exposure.Report and mute: Help reduce scam visibility by reporting fake accounts and muting anything suspicious in your feed.Stay informed: Follow credible sources for updates on new phishing tactics, wallet drainers and trending scam formats.Remember, a little caution goes a long way in keeping your assets and identity protected in a space where trust is often the first thing targeted.

X is a powerful platform for staying informed about crypto, but it’s also a favorite target for scammers. Knowing how to protect your account and your assets can save you from serious losses.

1inch promises faster, smarter, cheaper trades with new upgrade

Decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator 1inch has deployed an update for its price route discovery algorithm, claiming up to 6.5% better swap rates.

In a June 10 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, 1inch claims its “Pathfinder” upgrade results in better swap rates, while also making them faster and more seamless. The new algorithm consolidates specific swap steps and maximizes the use of concentrated liquidity, promising better gas efficiency.

A 1inch representative said the team hopes the gas efficiency improvements will decrease the barrier to entry for retail investors. “This can encourage more frequent usage and build trust in DeFi platforms, making DeFi more accessible,” they said.

On the user experience front, 1inch said the decentralized application (DApp) now also shows its users enhanced visualizations, providing insights into token and transaction execution. Sergej Kunz, co-founder of 1inch, claimed that the update “enables users and integrators to maximize the value of every trade” and cut gas costs.

1inch keeps building

The announcement follows the launch of 1inch on Solana at the end of April. The team said the integration enables users to trade over one million Solana-based tokens directly through 1inch.

At the time, the 1inch team also revealed its intention to roll out crosschain functionality. This would enable swaps between Solana and more than 10 other networks already supported by the aggregators. However, a representative noted that there is still no fixed launch date for the feature.

The decentralized exchange aggregator appears to be on a lucky streak. In early May, the platform successfully recovered most of the $5 million stolen in a recent exploit after negotiating a bug bounty agreement with the attacker.

Taking on decentralized finance

1inch hopes that by implementing gradual improvements, it will win an increasingly large slice of the decentralized finance (DeFi) pie. A representative told Cointelegraph that “these features help 1inch outperform competitors in swap efficiency and gas savings.”

“As rivals focus on single-venue liquidity, 1inch’s edge lies in dynamic aggregation across ecosystems, making it more adaptable and attractive to users and integrators alike,“ they added.

Stablecoins may be safer than bank deposits: Proof of Talk panel

### 링크

### 본문
Stablecoins may be safer than deposits held at commercial banks, according to Diogo Monica, general partner at Haun Ventures.

Speaking during a panel discussion titled “Stablecoins: Programmable Money in a Digital World” at the Proof of Talk conference in Paris on June 10, Monica said that many stablecoins are backed by reserves held at globally systemically important banks (G-SIBs) or in short-term US Treasury bills, which he views as more secure than commercial bank deposits.

“It’s actually much better than having a dollar in a commercial bank,” Monica said.

Monica’s comment referred to the fact that a deposit at a commercial bank is a liability for the bank, with possible consequences for the creditor if the bank fails and they are not covered by depositor insurance. A reliable stablecoin issuer is expected to rely on G-SIB deposits or short-term treasury bills instead, which are arguably safer.

Put simply, Monica argued that stablecoins represent a title to top-tier collateral rather than a potentially shaky regional bank. Still, stablecoins and their issuers often introduce their very own category of risk.

Tether case highlights stablecoin risk

While stablecoins may offer stronger collateralization in theory, their reliability depends heavily on the behavior of the issuing entity. Tether, the largest centralized stablecoin issuer by market cap, has faced repeated scrutiny over transparency and risk management.

In late 2018, Crypto Capital — the payment processor of Tether-tied cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex — lost access to approximately $850 million worth of exchange assets. Court documents show how this led to Tether lending at least $625 million of its reserves to Bitfinex to keep the platform solvent.

“At no time did Bitfinex or Tether disclose to the market that Tether had transferred at least $625 million to Bitfinex, or that Bitfinex had experienced critical liquidity issues,“ the court documents read.

In an affidavit filed on April 30, 2019, Tether’s general counsel stated that USDt (USDT) was approximately 74% backed by cash and equivalents due to the loan. The stablecoin remained liquid until Bitfinex fully repaid its debt to Tether, wiring the last $550 million in early 2021.

Lack of transparency still an issue

Despite publishing reserve attestations in recent years, Tether has yet to produce a full independent audit. In March, CEO Paolo Ardoino stated that the company is “engaging with a Big Four accounting firm” as it pursues a long-awaited audit of its reserves. Still, no audit has been announced so far.

This lack of assurances led Cyber Capital founder Justin Bons to go as far as to claim that Tether is “one of the biggest existential threats to crypto as a whole” in late 2024. He said at the time:

“An ‘Auditor’s Report’ or an ‘Accountant Report’ is not a formal audit at all! Despite the claims, Tether has never submitted its alleged reserves to a real unrestricted, third-party audit!”

Meta’s Bitcoin rejection means Big Tech is still skeptical

### 링크
https://cointelegraph.com/news/meta-bitcoin-big-tech?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

### 본문
Strategy became the first publicly traded company to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset in August 2020, but not many major tech firms have followed since.

Treasury reserves, sometimes called cash reserves, are held by corporations to fund short-term or emergency obligations. These are typically cash or cash equivalents like money market funds or three-month US Treasury bills.

The social media giant Meta keeps $72 billion in liquid assets in its reserve. But at its annual meeting on May 28, shareholders turned back a proposal to assess whether Bitcoin (BTC) might qualify as a future treasury reserve asset. The proposal was dismissed by a ratio of 1,221 to 1.

That rejection in itself is not so surprising. Despite growing corporate Bitcoin adoption, Big Tech and most mainstream corporations remain cautious. US tech giant Microsoft also voted down similar proposals in December 2024.

Meta’s failed Bitcoin proposal, rejected by an overwhelming majority, raises questions about institutional readiness to adopt crypto.

Bitcoin’s volatility weakens its treasury asset case

This could all just be a misunderstanding. Crypto partisans may have failed to realize that corporate treasuries are more like emergency funds: to be used in the event of natural disasters or pandemics or to support day-to-day business operations, but not as a platform for speculative investing, said New York University professor Aswath Damodaran.

“I think it is lunacy,” he told Cointelegraph, discussing the recent Meta proposal put forth by Bitcoin advocate Ethan Peck. Damodaran said that he couldn’t think of “a semblance of a reason for why this is a good idea.”

Related: Michael Saylor teases fresh Bitcoin buy after $1B stock offering

Damodaran has a reputation as a crypto skeptic. But even Duke University finance professor.

Campbell Harvey, who has written a book on decentralized finance and is mostly positive about the future of blockchain technology, was dismissive of the Bitcoin treasury initiative, telling Cointelegraph:

“If Meta investors want to own Bitcoin, they can buy it themselves. It is not clear what role cryptos play in any treasury function unless the company is doing business in a crypto like Bitcoin.”

Stablecoins properly qualify as a treasury reserve, as they are typically liquid and pegged to an underlying asset, such as the US dollar, Harvey said, comparing Bitcoin to a highly volatile instrument that isn’t suitable for corporate reserves.

Strategy’s successful Bitcoin blueprint has inspired other companies to jump on the bandwagon, Harvey suggested. Strategy’s MSTR has notched a 2,466% stock increase since the tech company made BTC its primary reserve asset, outperforming companies like Nvidia, Tesla, Google and Microsoft.

“But Strategy has bet the company in transforming itself into an active Bitcoin fund,” said Harvey, adding:

“If a company wants to make a strategic investment in Bitcoin just like they might make a strategic investment in a startup, I have no problem with that. It is a risky venture investment, and companies do this all the time. Just don’t call this a treasury asset.”

Still, the Metas of the world often hold billions of dollars in their cash reserves, and that money is often just parked there, earning little interest. For professional investors, that’s something like a sin.

“Meta is sitting with billions in cash constantly,” David Tawil, president and co-founder of ProChain Capital, told Cointelegraph. “They’re always holding cash.” They’d be better off putting some of it in Bitcoin, both for diversification purposes, but also to insulate them against an inflating dollar.

James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset investment firm CoinShares, told Cointelegraph that a 3% Bitcoin allocation can double a fund’s Sharpe ratio, a gauge used to assess risk-adjusted performance.

CoinShares’ own survey, which tracks $1 trillion in assets under management (AUM), shows that the average digital asset allocation rose to 1.8% in April 2025 from 1% in October 2024. “The pace of adoption is accelerating faster than we had anticipated,” Butterfill added.

Sign of a more cautious Bitcoin approach

Meta’s shareholder vote may reflect a broader sense of caution among mainstream corporate and institutional investors when it comes to Bitcoin. But CEO Mark Zuckerberg controls 61% of Meta’s voting power, so this isn’t necessarily a representative sample of corporate America.

Stefan Padfield, executive director of the Free Enterprise Project at the National Center for Public Policy Research, told Cointelegraph that corporate boards and managers are likely as divided on Bitcoin as economists and politicians, “so it’s not surprising that we’re seeing firms — including tech firms — take differing positions on the ‘none-some-lots’ spectrum when it comes to Bitcoin.”

And maybe there is less here than meets the eye. Padfield added:

“While the proposal is merely requesting consideration of Bitcoin, it may still be rejected simply because managers and investors don’t want to be told what to do in this space.”

Meanwhile, some of the world’s largest asset managers like Fidelity and BlackRock have warmed to crypto. BlackRock recently recommended that investors consider putting up to 2% of their portfolio in Bitcoin for diversification.

Bitcoin treasury initiatives have been ramping up globally. On June 3, Paris-based Blockchain Group announced that it added $68 million in Bitcoin to its corporate treasury. Then on June 4, Korea’s K Wave Media announced plans to raise $500 million to purchase Bitcoin in what it described as a “treasury strategy.”

At least 72 new companies have adopted Bitcoin this year, Butterfill said, though “many of these moves appear to be driven more by a desire to flatter their stock prices rather than a genuine belief in the long-term value of holding Bitcoin on the balance sheet.” A truly strategic allocation requires a long-term mindset, he pointed out.

But what about major corporations whose core business has nothing to do with crypto or blockchain technology? So far, Tesla stands alone among this group, noted Butterfill, adding:

“Given current trends, it’s likely that we’ll eventually see a major large-cap company add Bitcoin to its balance sheet.”

Still, returning to Meta, the 1,221:1 rejection ratio was rather emphatic, no?

Meta shareholders may have overreacted to Bitcoin’s so-called volatility, suggested Butterfill. “Bitcoin has exhibited consistently lower volatility than Meta for over two months now, and this trend holds across the FAANG stocks more broadly,” he said.

Padfield added, “I’m always concerned that people read too much into low [proxy] vote counts. In this case, it may simply be a reflection of a desire to avoid being ‘forced’ to consider Bitcoin than a rejection of Bitcoin itself.”

How to report a Bitcoin scam using Chainabuse and Scamwatch

### 링크
https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-use-chainabuse-and-scamwatch-to-report-a-bitcoin-scammer?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

### 본문
Key takeaways

Chainabuse allows anyone to publicly share information with enforcement, helping make crypto fraud more transparent, but it’s not a confidential legal channel.

Scamwatch helps raise public awareness about crypto scams in Australia and gathers reports to support national anti-scam efforts, but it does not investigate or take enforcement action. Even if funds can’t be recovered, reporting a Bitcoin scam can prevent someone else from falling into the same trap.

Staying vigilant, avoiding suspicious links or promises of guaranteed returns and double-checking addresses can help protect your crypto.

It begins with an apparently innocent message, like a friend offering a crypto opportunity or an internet stranger guaranteeing big Bitcoin (BTC) profits. Before you realize it, the person on the other end vanishes, and your money, cryptocurrency or fiat, is gone. Unfortunately, as cryptocurrency frauds become increasingly complex and omnipresent, incidents like this are becoming all too usual.

Even though recovering stolen money can often be tricky, there is something you can do: Report the scam. By sharing your story, other people can be protected from falling into the same trap, and platforms like Chainabuse and Scamwatch help facilitate this process.

This article explores how to detect and report Bitcoin scams and use trusted tools to protect yourself and others.

What are Chainabuse and Scamwatch?

When reporting crypto scams, knowing where to report is as important as what to report. Two tools that can help you report crypto fraud are Chainabuse and Scamwatch, each offering different but valuable ways to take action.

Chainabuse is a global reporting platform designed to fight crypto scams at scale. It allows anyone to report malicious crypto activity, from fake Bitcoin wallet addresses to phishing sites. Reports are public, helping protect others and alerting top crypto organizations in real time.

Additionally, users can access general guidance on how to stay safe and report the incident to law enforcement, based on similar reports submitted to the platform. Chainabuse also connects related reports, helping expose larger scams and supporting investigations.

Scamwatch is operated by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to collect scam reports, share warnings and help disrupt fraud. When you report a scam, your information helps identify the most harmful scams affecting Australians. Scamwatch may share data trends and insights with law enforcement and other government agencies to support broader investigations, but individual reports are not automatically escalated or acted upon. Its website, social media accounts and tools such as the Little Book of Scams provide helpful guidance on identifying, avoiding and recovering from scams. Scamwatch helps protect Australians from fraud both online and offline by collaborating with companies, governmental organizations and the general public.

Both platforms aim to empower users, raise awareness and support broader efforts to fight crypto-related fraud. Did you know? In 2024, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) received over 140,000 complaints involving cryptocurrency scams, totaling $9.3 billion in losses. Older adults over 60 were the most impacted, filing about 33,000 complaints and losing approximately $2.8 billion. The numbers highlight how crucial scam awareness and reporting have become, especially for protecting vulnerable communities.

How to use Chainabuse and Scamwatch to report a Bitcoin scammer

Reporting a cryptocurrency scammer is easier than it sounds, especially with platforms like Chainabuse and Scamwatch.Before you begin, gather as many details as possible. This includes what happened, how you were contacted, the scammer’s wallet address, etc. The more context you provide, the easier it is for investigators, platforms and other users to spot patterns.

Reporting Bitcoin scammers on Chainabuse

To report a Bitcoin scam on Chainabuse, visit Chainabuse.com and click “Report Your Case.” You’ll be asked to choose a scam category from a dropdown list. Then, describe what happened in detail. Try to stick to facts while leaving out personal information. If you can, upload any screenshots or documents that support your case.

Chainabuse encourages users to include technical data like:

The scammer’s blockchain address and the chain it belongs to.

Any URLs or domain names used in the scam.

The amount of money lost or demanded, in USD.

Transaction hashes linked to the incident.

Details such as the scammer’s IP address, token ID or contact info.

To find a scammer’s blockchain address, check your wallet’s transaction history and look for the address to which you sent funds. On Etherscan or similar explorers, the transaction will also include a hash (TxID).It’s possible to choose whether to post your report publicly or submit it privately. Public reports help warn others, while private ones are shared only with Chainabuse’s law enforcement partners. Either way, your personal details remain confidential.

Reporting Bitcoin scammer on Scamwatch

If you’re in Australia or the scam involves an Australian entity, head to Scamwatch.gov.au and click “Report a Scam.” The form will prompt you to provide:

The type of scam and when it occurred.

How the scammer contacted you.

A description of the event

Whether the scammer impersonated a known institution or individual.

Any contact details, websites or addresses they used.

Expect to be asked if the scammer took money, personal information, or cryptocurrency. It’s also possible to aAttach any screenshots or documentation to support your claim.

Once complete, review your information and hit submit. While Scamwatch doesn’t investigate individual reports, your input contributes to broader scam monitoring and prevention.

What happens after you report a Bitcoin scam?

After reporting a scam, you may be curious about what comes next. By making your report searchable and publicly accessible, Chainabuse helps others identify shady wallet addresses or fake websites. Also, crypto exchanges, compliance teams and cryptocurrency companies can use the information to detect or freeze assets linked to fraudulent conduct.

After using Scamwatch, your report is added to a nationwide database that the ACCC monitors. Although Scamwatch does not look into specific cases or provide refunds, your information is used to inform the public and assist government initiatives in finding major scammers.

It's essential to keep in mind that while reporting fraud does not guarantee that your money will be returned, it does significantly reduce the likelihood of scams in the future. The more people disclose these cases, the more efficient the crypto industry protects its community against fraud.

Did you know? Some scammers recycle the same wallet addresses across dozens of schemes. That’s why Chainabuse’s public reports are so powerful. They help link separate scam reports to the same bad actors, uncovering larger fraud networks hiding in plain sight.

Alternatives to reporting a Bitcoin scammer

Although Scamwatch and Chainabuse are two practical resources for reporting cryptocurrency fraud, there are other Bitcoin scam reporting sites.  For instance, scams involving digital assets can be reported to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) and the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Action Fraud serves a similar purpose in the UK. Reporting the scam to multiple platforms can boost visibility and improve the chances that authorities or relevant organizations will take action.

Tips to avoid Bitcoin scams in the future

The crypto space moves fast, and so do scammers. Whether you’re new to Bitcoin or an experienced user, staying alert is essential.

Here are some of the top tips to help you protect yourself:

Never trust guaranteed returns. No one can promise you profits in crypto; if it sounds too good to be true, it’s probably a scam.

Double-check wallet addresses. Always verify the recipient address before sending Bitcoin. Even one wrong character can send your funds to a scammer.

Beware of impersonators. Scammers often pretend to be from customer support, influencers or even crypto companies. Always confirm through official websites or verified channels.

Avoid clicking suspicious links. Phishing websites may look real, but they are designed to steal your private keys or trick you into connecting your wallet.

Use public tools. Before interacting with a wallet or project, search it on platforms like Chainabuse to see if others have reported suspicious activity.

Even with all these precautions, it’s essential to acknowledge that scams can happen to anyone. It’s natural to feel ashamed, angry or sad afterward, and many victims stay silent. But scammers rely on that silence. They count on people being too embarrassed to speak up, which allows them to continue targeting others. Talking about what happened and reporting it breaks the cycle and turns a painful experience into a powerful way to protect the next person.

This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision.

Trump-backed American Bitcoin accumulates 215 BTC since April launch

### 본문
American Bitcoin, a Bitcoin mining firm backed by President Donald Trump’s two eldest sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., has quietly built up a 215 BTC reserve since its April 1 debut.

The company, formally known as ABTC, is positioning itself not just as another mining venture but as a long-term accumulator of Bitcoin (BTC), it disclosed in a June 6 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The stash, currently worth over $23 million, was not previously disclosed. “ABTC considers its reserve a core strategic asset, managed adaptively to support balance sheet strength with a view to enhancing long-term stockholder value,” the firm stated.

The firm added that its accumulation strategy is open-ended, meaning no fixed BTC target exists. Instead, it continually assesses market conditions to raise capital when favorable and expand its holdings.

“Bitcoin accumulation is not a side effect of ABTC’s business. It is the business. ABTC’s layer 2 strategy is designed to transform its Bitcoin production into long-term Bitcoin ownership,” it wrote.

Mining without owning the real estate

In the filing, ABTC said it invests directly in mining rather than investing in physical infrastructure. The firm owns over 60,000 miners, primarily from Bitmain and MicroBT, deployed across three Hut 8-managed facilities in New York, Alberta and Texas.

These miners operate at a combined hashrate of 10.17 exahashes per second and average efficiency of 21.2 joules per terahash. The partnership with Hut 8 allows ABTC to keep overhead low while scaling output and preserving capital flexibility.

ABTC’s miners contribute computing power to established pools like Foundry and Luxor. Daily mining rewards are distributed based on hashrate contributions, with pool fees kept below 1%.

At its core, ABTC runs on what it calls a three-tiered strategy. This includes building a cost-efficient mining operation, leveraging capital to grow its BTC reserves, and playing an active role in Bitcoin’s broader ecosystem.

ABTC stores its Bitcoin with Coinbase Custody in cold wallets, applying multifactor authentication and whitelisted withdrawal protocols to improve security, the firm said.

American Bitcoin to go public via Gryphon merger

On May 12, American Bitcoin announced plans to go public through a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining. The deal will be structured as a stock-for-stock transaction, with the merged entity operating under the American Bitcoin brand.

Eric Trump will sit on the company’s board following the merger. Furthermore, American Bitcoin is majority-owned by Hut 8, which will retain a management role post-merger.

Under the agreement, current American Bitcoin shareholders will hold approximately 98% of the new company. Hut 8 will continue managing mining infrastructure and operations, with expectations of generating stable revenue through long-term commercial agreements.

From ownership to opportunity, Web3 is still on a mission to reshape music

https://cointelegraph.com/news/from-ownership-to-opportunity-web3-is-still-on-a-mission-to-reshape-music?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

### 본문
As streaming platforms dominate music distribution, artists have increasingly found themselves sidelined and earning fractions of pennies per play, all while relying on centralized platforms to reach fans.

However, in a corner of the digital world, a new wave of creators, developers and platforms are exploring how Web3 tools can offer an alternative.

Decentralized music platforms

Decentralized, Web3-native music platforms have emerged in recent years to offer artists more control over their content, more direct access to their audiences and better monetization models.

Many of these music-related use cases are not just theoretical and are already in the community at work.

Instead of uploading songs to a platform that owns the data and controls the algorithm, artists’ options are expanding to distribute their music through decentralized platforms, like Audius, or token-gate content and even offer collectible versions of tracks that fans can own and trade.

In an interview with Cointelegraph in late 2024, Dave Stewart of Eurythmics, who co-founded the Web3 music platform SongBits, told Cointelegraph:

“Web3 allows us to ensure complete transparency in how these funds are handled, giving fans and contributors peace of mind that their support is making a real difference.”

Leading by example

Now, Cointelegraph is joining the experiment. To mark the recent launch of its new daily X show Chain Reaction, Cointelegraph has partnered with Audius to launch a remix contest to find the show’s official theme song.

Related: AI can compose good music, but humanity still holds the creative baton

Artists from all corners of the web are invited to use the remix feature on Cointelegraph’s base track on the Cointelegraph Audius profile and upload their original theme song to Audius with the tag #CTChainReactionTheme.

The winner’s music will be featured daily as the intro and outro to the show, and they’ll also be invited for a brief guest appearance. For full contest info and prize package, visit the event page.

It’s a small contest, but it reflects a bigger shift: Decentralized creator ecosystems have real-world applications that work and can thrive, not just as marketing stunts, but as a way to engage more directly with Web3-native communities.

As music, content and culture become increasingly intertwined with onchain infrastructure, the creative economy may finally be heading toward something more equitable and more fun.

Mystery whale opens $300M leveraged Bitcoin bet: James Wynn alt account?

### 링크

### 본문
A mystery investor has opened a $300 million leveraged Bitcoin position, fueling speculation around their identity.

The unknown whale, or large cryptocurrency holder, opened a 20x leveraged Bitcoin (BTC) long position worth over $308 million at the entry price of $108,100, Hypurrscan blockchain data shows.

The position currently shows an unrealized profit of more than $4 million and faces liquidation if Bitcoin drops below $105,780.

The trade has reignited speculation around James Wynn, a high-profile leverage trader who recently lost nearly $25 million in a separate liquidation on June 5, as Cointelegraph previously reported.

The long position was opened hours after Wynn announced that he is back under an anonymous account, without specifying the wallet address.

“I’m back in the casino under an alt account so the cabal market makers can’t find me,” wrote Wynn in a June 10 X post.

Blockchain data platform Onchain Lens also pointed out that Wynn may be behind the $300 million leveraged long.

“They are hunting me,” claimed Wynn before $100 million liquidation

After opening his second $100 million leveraged Bitcoin position, Wynn claimed that his liquidation level is being deliberately targeted by orchestrated efforts from major market participants.

“They’re coming for me again,” wrote Wynn, disclosing his previous liquidation level in a June 2 X post. “Don’t let these evil bastards liquidate me,” he added.

Wynn also claimed that some of his personal accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges were “closed overnight” for no obvious reason.

While the identity of the mysterious whale remains unclear, the $300 million bet coincides with a renewed “wave of institutional breakthroughs” for Bitcoin, according to Nexo dispatch editor Stella Zlatareva.

“Corporate treasury activity continues to expand,” she told Cointelegraph, referencing Strategy’s $1 billion stock offering to fund its Bitcoin purchases, which was upsized from the previously announced $250 million.

Adding to the rising investor sentiment, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded $386 million worth of net positive inflows on Monday, June 9, recovering from a two-day sell-off, Farside Investors data shows.

The structural inflows from ETFs and institutions may help Bitcoin surpass the $200,000 “base case” before the end of 2025, Bitwise’s head of European research, André Dragosch, told Cointelegraph.

Bitcoin proxy stocks for investors in 2025: Strategy Inc vs. BlackRock, compared

Meanwhile, IBIT offers a cleaner, regulated route: a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) backed by actual Bitcoin (BTC), built for institutional and retail investors alike.

This article compares the two as portfolio proxies, looking at risk, performance and who each one is really for.

It will start with Strategy’s story, explaining how it became one of the best-known Bitcoin proxy stocks.

Inside Strategy’s crypto portfolio

In August 2020, under the leadership of Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy made a dramatic pivot: allocating $250 million from its cash reserves to purchase roughly 21,454 BTC.This marked a move from business intelligence software to a Bitcoin treasury company. At the time, Saylor argued that Bitcoin was a stronger, more modern form of digital gold than cash and effectively transformed the company into a unique financial instrument, offering investors leveraged exposure to Bitcoin through equity.From that initial investment, the company institutionalized its crypto strategy. By late 2024, it had amassed around 444,000 BTC, funded through convertible bonds, equity raises and debt, essentially borrowing to buy more Bitcoin in a high-stakes flywheel approach.Then, in February 2025, MicroStrategy formally changed its name to Strategy Inc, complete with a stylized “B” logo and orange branding, officially embracing its Bitcoin-first identity.As of mid‑2025, Strategy holds approximately 580,250 BTC, solidifying its position as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally.Did you know? Strategy holds more Bitcoin than most countries. In fact, it holds more than all sovereign nations except the US, China and the UK.

What is BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF stock?

Now let’s turn to BlackRock, whose entry into the Bitcoin market brought the world’s largest asset manager into direct competition with long-time crypto natives.In January 2024, after years of US SEC resistance, the regulator approved a slate of spot Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was among them.Unlike Strategy, which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet, IBIT is a pure financial product: a one-to-one, physically backed ETF that allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without touching the asset itself. No wallets or private keys — just a ticker, a brokerage account and an SEC filing.The reception was explosive. By February 2024, IBIT had gathered over $50 billion in assets under management, becoming one of the fastest-growing ETFs in history.BlackRock didn’t stop there. In March 2025, it launched a European version of the fund across Xetra, Euronext Paris and Amsterdam with a temporary 0.15% management fee, one of the lowest in the industry.Perhaps most telling is how seriously BlackRock is taking this bet. In early 2025, the firm added IBIT to several of its model portfolios, including multi-asset and alternative strategies.Executives have even suggested that Bitcoin may be starting to decouple from tech stocks, offering unique diversification for modern portfolios.Did you know? BlackRock filed its Bitcoin ETF application using Coinbase for both custody and surveillance-sharing, marking one of the first times a major asset manager partnered with a crypto-native exchange to meet SEC demands.

Bitcoin proxy stocks comparison

Strategy and IBIT both offer exposure to Bitcoin, but how they do it and what that means for investors couldn’t be more different.Strategy (MSTR) has consistently outperformed Bitcoin over the past five years, thanks to leverage and aggressive accumulation. But with that upside comes volatility: The stock often swings harder than Bitcoin itself. IBIT, by contrast, is built to track Bitcoin’s price directly. It does so with high accuracy but lags slightly due to management fees.The risk profiles reflect this split. Strategy is a high-beta equity with corporate balance sheet exposure. It relies on convertible debt and equity raises to fuel its BTC strategy. IBIT avoids all of that. As a spot ETF, it holds Bitcoin in custody and gives investors clean exposure without company-specific risks.Fees and taxes also differ. Strategy has no annual management cost, but investors take on potential dilution, corporate tax effects and governance risks. IBIT charges around 0.15%-0.20% annually (free through 2025 in Europe) but comes with tight spreads, deep liquidity and no corporate baggage.Here’s how Strategy (MSTR) is different from BlackRock (IBIT):

Why is Ethereum (ETH) price up today?

### 링크
https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-ethereum-eth-price-up-today?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss%3F&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

### 본문
Key points:

Ethereum price is up 7% on June 10 to trade above $2,680.

ETH’s record open interest, rising funding rates and consistent ETF inflows fuel the rally.

Ether’s bullish cup-and-handle pattern targets $4,100.

Ether’s (ETH) price was trading at $2,679 on June 10, up more than 7% in the last 24 hours. Its daily trading volume has jumped 114% to $26.5 billion, reinforcing the intensity of the demand-side activity.

Let’s look at the factors driving the ETH price up today.

Ethereum ETPs maintain their inflow streak

Global Ethereum-based investment products continued their positive streak last week, with net inflows of $295.4 million, according to CoinShares. The products have now recorded a seventh straight week of inflows, totaling $1.5 billion.

CoinShares head of research James Butterfill said:

“This represents the strongest run of inflows since the US election last November and marks a significant recovery in sentiment among investors.”

US-based spot Ethereum ETFs, led by BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), recorded inflows totaling $52.7 million on June 9 and registered 16 consecutive days of inflows amounting to $890 million.

These inflows indicate investor “sentiment shift” toward ETH investment products and point to renewed institutional interest, said trading firm QCP in a June 10 Telegram note to subscribers, adding:

“This rotation suggests a broadening thesis, from Bitcoin as digital gold to Ethereum as the infrastructure layer for real-world assets.”

ETH open interest hits all-time highs

Ether futures open interest (OI) hit a record high on June 10. This suggests that large investors are positioning for a potential rally toward $3,000.

The aggregate OI in Ether futures rose 12.7% in the last 24 hours, hitting a record $39.22 billion on June 10. Binance, Gate.io, Bybit, and Bitget control over 51% of the market, while the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) holds 7.4% of ETH open interest, according to CoinGlass data.

Also backing Ether’s upside are positive funding rates in ETH perpetual futures markets. Funding rates represent the periodic payments exchanged between long and short-position holders. This metric has increased to 0.0070% on June 10 from $0.0026% over the last 48 hours.

This rise in OI shows more money entering the market. While higher funding rates indicate that more traders are going long (betting on higher prices) and are willing to pay to keep those positions open.

Both metrics signal bullish bias among ETH futures traders.

Ether’s cup-and-handle chart pattern eyes $4,100

From a technical perspective, the ETH/USD pair has been forming a cup-and-handle chart pattern on its daily chart time frame since Feb. 3.

A cup-and-handle setup is a technical pattern that appears when the price falls initially, followed by a steady recovery in what appears to be a U-shaped recovery, which forms the cup. The recovery leads to a pullback move, wherein the price trends lower inside a descending channel, forming the handle.

The pattern is resolved when the price breaks above the pattern’s neckline, rallying as high as the length of the prior decline. The ETH/USD daily chart below illustrates a similar bullish technical setup.

Note that ETH now trades above the handle range and is pursuing a recovery toward the neckline resistance at $2,789.

A decisive daily candlestick close above the neckline could lead the Ether price to confront resistance at the $3,000 range high.

Breaking this barrier would clear the path toward the technical target of the prevailing chart pattern above $4,100, up 52% from the current level.

Several analysts share this outlook, with MN Capital founder Michael van de Poppe saying that ETH price needs to overcome resistance between $2,800-$3,000 before embarking on the “next leg up.”

“I assume we'll start to see a leg to $3,400-$3,500 if it breaks the resistance at $2,800.”

As Cointelegraph reported, the ETH/USD pair must break the resistance at $2,739 for the price to rally past $3,000.

87 deepfake scam rings taken down across Asia in Q1 2025: Report

### 본문
The rise of artificial intelligence is fueling a sharp increase in crypto-related fraud, with deepfake technology driving a surge in sophisticated scams, according to a new report.

In the first quarter of 2025, at least 87 scam rings using AI-generated deepfakes were dismantled, according to the 2025 Anti-Scam Research Report co-authored by crypto exchange Bitget, blockchain security firm SlowMist, and analytics provider Elliptic.

The report also reveals crypto scams reached $4.6 billion in 2024, marking a 24% increase from the year before. Nearly 40% of high-value fraud cases involved deepfake technologies, with scammers increasingly using sophisticated impersonations of public figures, founders and platform executives to deceive users.

Related: How AI and deepfakes are fueling new cryptocurrency scams

“The speed at which scammers can now generate synthetic videos, coupled with the viral nature of social media, gives deepfakes a unique advantage in both reach and believability,” said Gracy Chen, the CEO of Bitget.

Deepfakes pose new threats

The report details the anatomy of modern crypto scams, pointing to three dominant categories: AI-generated deepfake impersonations, social engineering schemes, and Ponzi-style frauds disguised as decentralized finance (DeFi) or GameFi projects. Deepfakes, it warned, are especially hard to detect.

AI can simulate text, voice messages, facial expressions and even actions. For example, fake video endorsements of investment platforms from public figures such as Singapore’s prime minister and Elon Musk are tactics used to exploit public trust via Telegram, X and other social media platforms.

AI can even simulate real-time reactions, making these scams increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality. Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of the blockchain platform Polygon, raised the alarm in a May 13 post on X, revealing that bad actors had been impersonating him via Zoom.

He mentioned that several people had contacted him on Telegram asking if he was on a Zoom call with them and whether he was requesting them to install a script.

SlowMist CEO Yu Xian urged users to verify the legitimacy of Zoom links and domain names to avoid falling victim to video-based impersonation scams.

New scam threats call for smarter defenses

As deepfake scams grow more convincing, security experts say education and vigilance are critical. For institutions, regular security training and strong technical defenses are essential, the report stated. Businesses are advised to run phishing simulations, protect email systems and monitor code for leaks. Building a security-first culture — where employees verify before they trust — is the best way to stop scams before they start, the report added.

Chen offered everyday users a straightforward approach: “Verify, isolate, and slow down.” She added:

“Always verify information through official websites or trusted social media accounts — never rely on links shared in Telegram chats or Twitter comments.”

Chen also stressed the importance of isolating risky actions by using separate wallets when exploring new platforms.

Apple, the world’s fourth-largest company by market capitalization, should buy Bitcoin (BTC) to address the poor performance of its stock buyback program, according to Strategy executive chairman, Michael Saylor.

“Apple should buy Bitcoin,” Saylor said in a June 10 X post.

Saylor’s comment responded to Jim Cramer’s criticism of the Apple buyback program.

“The Apple buyback is not working right now,” Cramer wrote in a June 10 X post.

“The company can leave it to earn a lot or it can take some and integrate. It is not a badge of dishonor. It just isn’t,” he added.

Apple’s buyback program aims to reduce the number of outstanding shares and return value to investors, according to the $110 billion stock buyback strategy announced in a May 2024 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

However, Apple’s stock has declined more than 17% since the start of the year.

Over the same period, Bitcoin has gained more than 17%, according to data from TradingView. Zooming out, Bitcoin has surged over 1,000% in the past five years, compared with a 137% increase in Apple shares.

Bitcoin’s corporate adoption is growing worldwide

The call for Apple to adopt Bitcoin comes as more companies move to add the cryptocurrency to their balance sheets.

On May 28, US video game and consumer electronics retailer GameStop announced its first Bitcoin investment, acquiring 4,710 BTC for around $513 million after the firm launched a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering.

Japanese investment company Metaplanet is spearheading Bitcoin adoption in Asia after becoming the world’s eighth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder on June 2.

Metaplanet’s shares soared over 12% during Monday’s trading session after the company announced plans to raise $5.4 billion worth of capital to buy more Bitcoin.

Over in Europe, Paris-based cryptocurrency firm The Blockchain Group announced plans to raise over $340 million for its Bitcoin treasury, Cointelegraph reported on Monday. The announcement came a week after the firm acquired $68 million worth of Bitcoin, pushing its total holdings to 1,471 Bitcoin, or over $154 million.

Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have made a comeback from a two-day sell-off, recording over $386 million worth of net positive inflows on June 9, Farside Investors data shows.

Bank of Japan pivot to QE may fuel Bitcoin rally — Arthur Hayes

The Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) upcoming monetary policy meeting in June may provide the next significant catalyst for global risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies.

The BoJ is set to take its next interest rate decision at its upcoming monetary policy meeting on June 16–17.

The central bank may provide the next significant catalyst for Bitcoin (BTC) and other risk assets if it pivots to quantitative easing (QE), according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and chief investment officer of Maelstrom.

“If the BOJ delays QT, and restarts selected QE at its June meeting risk assets are going to fly,” Hayes wrote in a June 10 X post.

QE refers to central banks buying bonds and pumping money into the economy to lower interest rates and encourage spending during difficult financial conditions.

On July 31, 2024, the Bank of Japan introduced a plan to cut government bond purchases by 400 billion yen per quarter, starting in August 2024. The quantitative tightening plan is set for an interim assessment period at the upcoming meeting on June 16, signaling a potential opportunity to pivot.

BoJ officials are reportedly discussing making smaller reductions to the bank’s bond buying, from the current 400 billion to 200 billion yen per quarter, starting from April 2027, unnamed sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.

Japanese bond market crisis was the catalyst for Bitcoin’s $112,000 high

Bitcoin rose to the $112,000 all-time high on May 22, two days after the 30-year yield on Japanese bonds reached a new all-time high of 3.185% on May 20, 2025.

The concerns around Japan’s sovereign bond market inspired institutions to reconsider Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against sovereign default risks, according to Bitwise’s head of European research, André Dragosch.

“Perceived default risk continues rising, yields continue rising? This is a rough benchmark of why Bitcoin could be heading toward $200,000,” Dragosch told Cointelegraph, adding that Bitcoin is “free from counterparty risk.”

Government bonds are typically considered safe-haven assets. But when yields rise sharply, it often signals investor concerns about fiscal sustainability and repayment risk.

Trump's CFTC Pick Says U.S. Can Boost Crypto Innovation and Shield Consumers

Brian Quintenz told senators at his confirmation hearing for CFTC chairman that Congress needs to ensure "full promise" of digital assets' potential.

President Donald Trump's pick to be chairman of the U.S. commodities watchdog, Brian Quintenz, fielded crypto questions more than any other topic at his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, and he assured the lawmakers that the agency can walk a middle ground between unhampered innovation and robust consumer safeguards.

Even as Quintenz awaits the Senate Agriculture Committee's vote on whether to advance his nomination as chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Congress is working on market structure legislation that could elevate that agency as the marquee regulator of U.S. crypto activity. Quintenz, a former CFTC commissioner, is no stranger to that sector, having served as venture capital firm a16z's head of policy.

"I have always viewed market structure legislation as an opportunity to be both pro-customer protection and pro-innovation at the same time," he told the senators weighing his nomination, which ultimately needs to be approved by the overall Senate before he can take over the commission. He said the bill could "provide the clarity to buildings, entrepreneurs, innovators to develop products" while also ensuring the regulated firms are appropriately protecting the users of those products.

"Congress should create an appropriate market regulatory regime to ensure that this technology’s full promise can be realized, and I am fully prepared to use my experience and expertise to assist in that effort as well in executing any expanded mission should legislation pass into law," Quintenz said, adding that he's willing to work under the CFTC's current powers "to provide clarity of how the agency’s statutory objectives could be successfully leveraged through this technology."

Quintenz would join a commission that's being abandoned by commissioners. By statute, the CFTC has five members — with three from the party in power — but the members have left or are in the process of leaving, including Acting Chairman Caroline Pham, who said she's leaving when Quintenz starts work. The lone Democrat, Kristen Johnson, said she'll depart "later this year," leaving some uncertainty about her timing. So Quintenz may serve opposite a single Democrat before eventually working alone for a time, leaving potential legal vulnerability for any unilateral policies.

Some of the Democratic senators noted the Trump administration has been systematically stripping regulatory commissions of their Democratic members — described by Senator Raphael Warnock as "political purges" — and asked Quintenz if he would encourage the White House to fill both sides of the roster.

"The president is the head of the executive, and the president will make his own decisions. Quintenz said. He later added, "I don't tell the president what to do."

He granted that the agency may need more funding if it's assigned the monumental new task as the regulator of digital commodities spot markets, which would include transactions of bitcoin BTC$109,626.49. Quintenz said that new staff would be made more efficient by "a technology-first approach" that makes the employees more efficient.

Quintenz also fielded a number of questions on the prediction markets, another area he's had direct experience with as a board member of Kalshi, which fought a legal battle with the CFTC over the regulation of event contracts. He defended such event contracts as an appropriate "hedging tool."

"I believe the Commodity Exchange Act is very clear about the purpose of derivatives markets, the purpose of risk management and price discovery, and that events [contracts] can serve a function in that mandate," he said.

Bitcoin Rises to $110K as Altcoins Rally; Traders Skeptical of Breakout

### 본문
Positioning across crypto markets doesn't suggest a top, but neither does it seem ideal for continued rally.

Bitcoin recaptured the $110,000 level for the second consecutive day, perhaps dragged higher by even larger gains among altcoins.

Up 0.9% more than 1% in the last 24 hours, bitcoin was trading just above $110,000 shortly after the close of U.S. stock markets Tuesday. The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins, exchange coins and memecoins — has risen 3.3% in the same period of time, mostly thanks to ether ETH$2,792.71, solana SOL$166.59, chainlink LINK$15.30 all gaining 5%-7%.

The standout performances, however, were put on by uniswap UNI$8.28 and aave AAVE$308.70, which soared a whooping 24% and 13%, respectively. The move was prompted by optimistic comments on the topic of DeFi by Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins on Monday.

Things have remained relatively calm on the equities front, with most crypto stocks flat on the day. A notable exception is Semler Scientific (SMLR), a firm that aims to follow Strategy’s (MSTR) playbook and vacuum up as much bitcoin as possible. Shares fell another 10% today, with the stock now trading for less than the value of the bitcoin on its balance sheet.

Despite the day’s gains, positioning across crypto markets still reflects a largely defensive tone.

"Funding rates and other leverage proxies point toward a steadily cautious sentiment in the market,” Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33 Research, pointed out in a Tuesday report. "The broad risk appetite is remarkably weak, given that BTC is trading close to former all-time highs."

Binance’s BTC perpetual swaps posted negative funding rates on multiple days last week, with the average annualized funding rate now sitting at just 1.3% — a level typically associated with local market bottoms rather than tops, Lunde noted.

"Bitcoin does not usually peak in environments with negative funding rates," he wrote, adding that past instances of such positioning have more often preceded rallies than corrections.

Flows into leveraged bitcoin ETFs paint a similar picture. The ProShares 2x Bitcoin ETF (BITX) currently holds exposure equivalent to 52,435 BTC — well below its December 2023 peak of 76,755 BTC — and inflows remain muted. This defensive positioning, according to Lunde, leaves room for a potential "healthy rally" in BTC to develop.

Still, not all market watchers are convinced that the current price action marks the start of a sustainable breakout.

"Is this a true breakout that will continue? In my view, probably not," said Kirill Kretov, senior automation expert at CoinPanel. "More likely, it’s part of the same volatility cycle where we see a rally now, followed by a sharp drop triggered by a negative announcement or some other narrative shift."

According to Kretov, the current environment favors experienced traders who can navigate volatility-driven market structure. Technically, he sees BTC's next key support levels at $105,000 and $100,000 — zones that could be tested if selling pressure returns.

The token broke through the psychological $5 resistance level on significant trading volume.

Aptos' APT token surged more than 4% following a bullish breakout, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model.

The token smashed through resistance at the $5 level and is currently 4.2% higher, trading around $5.065.

Despite facing a 19% monthly decline and competition from emerging blockchain platforms, APT's recent price action suggests potential accumulation before its next significant move, according to the model.

Solana's SOL Jumps 5% on Report of Spot ETF Development

The SEC asked prospective ETF issuers to amend key paperwork, Blockworks reported.

Solana SOL$167.04 surged 5% in after U.S. hours on Tuesday on a Blockworks report saying that U.S. regulators are moving forward in the regulatory process necessary to make spot SOL exchange-traded funds (ETF) reality.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly asked prospective issuers to amend their S-1 filings in the next week, according to the story, and will comment on the paperwork in the next 30 days after submission.

SOL jumped above $164 in the minutes following the report, up nearly 5% over the past 24 hours.

After the debut of bitcoin BTC$109,626.49 and ether ETH$2,794.04 spot ETFs in the U.S. last year, asset managers are racing to get regulatory approval to launch similar vehicles for smaller cryptocurrencies, offering traditional investors easier access to invest in digital assets. Several asset managers have filed applications with the SEC to launch funds holding SOL, including Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton and VanEck.

CoinDesk reached out to prospective issuers for confirmation but had not yet heard back at time of publication.

Ether Roars Past $2,700; Popular Trader Declares ‘Beast Mode’

### 본문
A 6.54% rally lifted ether above $2,700 on heavy volume as traders and executives forecast further upside toward $4,000.

Ether (ETH) ETH$2,794.04 began the 24-hour session around $2,576 in early Asian trading, briefly dipped to $2,562 on light volume, then saw buying interest surge around 21:00 UTC on June 9 as turnover topped 436,000 coins, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model.

A second wave of demand just before 11:00 UTC on June 10 drove ether through the $2,700 barrier to a 24-hour high of $2,783; by press time it was trading at $2,744.87, up 6.54 percent on 560,900 coins (US$1.51 billion) moved.

Social sentiment has turned decidedly bullish. A popular trader on X said the move amounted to ether entering a true “beast mode” phase after brushing aside $1,500 and $2,200 barriers and forecast further upside toward $4,000 and beyond.

In an X thread on June 3, Consensys founder Joseph Lubin portrayed Etheruem as a nonstop settlement layer that processed over $25 trillion in transactions last year and serves as the backbone for stablecoins, tokenized assets, native yield and DeFi. He added that a $425 million private placement into SharpLink Gaming (SBET) aims to expose traditional investors to those yield opportunities.

Meanwhile, in a market note, QCP Capital pointed to the advancing GENIUS Act, renewed buzz around Circle’s IPO and increasing regulatory clarity for stablecoins as converging tailwinds that could drive outsized structural gains for Ether’s tokenization and settlement rails.

On-chain fundamentals also bolster the bullish case: staked ether recently reached a record 34.65 million tokens — locking up roughly 28.7 percent of supply — and may tighten bids around current support near $2,720.

Cathie Wood's ARK Invest: Bitcoin Gains Coming Alongside Clear Stress in Housing, Autos

Bitcoin's current rally doesn’t yet reflect speculative excess, the asset manager said in a new report.

Bitcoin’s BTC$109,626.49 rise to new all-time highs is happening on a backdrop of deep economic strain, according to a new report from Cathie Wood-led ARK Invest.

Bitcoin's 11.1% climb in May, outpaced gold and broke through key resistance levels, said ARK. Gains also coincided with clear signs of stress in the housing and auto sectors, traditionally seen as pillars of U.S. consumer strength.

In housing, the number of sellers has far outpaced buyers, a trend ARK links to the Federal Reserve’s steep rate hikes since 2022. With affordability deteriorating, pressure is mounting on prices in what remains the largest source of household net worth. Meanwhile, auto sales, which surged earlier this year in anticipation of tariffs, collapsed in May — falling to 15.6 million units from above 17 million just a month prior.

As these markets soften, bitcoin appears to be catching some of the capital looking for yield and resilience, ARK noted. Spot bitcoin ETFs drew $5.5 billion in May — more than triple the inflows seen in gold ETFs, which dropped sharply during the same period.

ARK noted that bitcoin’s current rally doesn’t yet reflect speculative excess. Profit-taking behavior remains measured, with unrealized gains sitting well below the levels that marked prior bubbles.

For investors moving away from stressed real-world assets, bitcoin may be serving not as a gamble, but as a calculated reallocation in a shifting economic landscape.

House Ag Committee Advances Market Structure Bill, Other Crypto Actions Pending

### 링크
https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/06/10/house-ag-committee-advances-market-structure-bill-other-crypto-actions-pending

### 본문
The market structure bill got an overhaul in two House committees at the same time while the Senate's stablecoin bill is steaming toward a finish.

The House Agriculture Committee sent a major bipartisan message with a 47-6 advancement of the U.S. crypto market structure bill on Tuesday, marking the first of several expected developments in the advancement of digital assets legislation expected this week.

A second congressional panel, the House Financial Services Committee, was also hashing out some of the final details on Tuesday on the bill to set up digital assets market oversight, and at the same time, the Senate's legislation to regulate stablecoin issuers was rolling toward a final vote.

This year's effort to finally set the U.S. stage for crypto trading, known as the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, was the focus of markups — special hearings in which congressional panels consider amendments and put a final polish on legislation before advancing it to the chamber floor. In this case, two House committees were considering the Clarity Act at the same time on Tuesday, and the agriculture panel finished first.

"The Clarity Act provides certainty on digital assets to market participants, fills regulatory gaps at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, bolsters American innovation and brings needed customer protections to digital asset related activities and intermediaries," said the agriculture panel's chairman, Glenn "GT" Thompson, as he opened his committee's hearing.

The panel's ranking Democrat, Representative Angie Craig, noted that "this is not a perfect bill," but also said the tens of millions of Americans using cryptocurrency "will continue to grow whether Congress acts or not, but if we don't act, it will grow without the consumer protections that retail investors need and deserve, protections like those that govern other corners of the American financial system."

The House bill outlines the jurisdictional borders between the two U.S. markets regulators and establishes a new leading role for the CFTC over the trading of digital commodities, which represents the bulk of crypto activity. Because the two congressional committees each oversees different elements of the crypto market — commodities and securities — each has a piece of the relevant jurisdiction, so the panels' work to amend the legislation will have to be melded.

Congressional staffers said that the products of successful markups from each committee would then be combined into a unified "committee report" to be considered by the wider House.

The legislation has been continually overhauled right up to the markups, with Republicans hoping to keep enough Democrats on board that a bipartisan support can influence how much the Senate embraces the bill if it passes the House. But Democrats in the House Financial Services Committee were still meeting to examine points of the bill they have concern with as recently as late Monday.

Representative David Scott, one of the Democrats who serves on both committees, expressed the discontent of some in his party. "The bill allows crypto firms to bypass proper oversight and ignore investor protections, as I have outlined on multiple occasions here and in the finance committee," he said, arguing that the bill doesn't properly fund the commodities regulator. "The CFTC, though essential, is not designed to oversee retail-facing investment products."

Scott added, "This is a gift to the worst actors in this industry."

Others remain concerned that the legislation doesn't directly block senior government officials — most notably President Donald Trump — from personally benefiting from crypto business interests.

Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, raised similar concerns when she introduced an amendment Tuesday to the HUD Transparency Act of 2025 that would direct its inspector-general to investigate a suggestion that the Department of Housing and Urban Development might evaluate crypto or stablecoins for payments.

"Unfortunately, Trump and his administration are trying to force crypto down the throats of people living in HUD-assisted housing," she said. "I for one would want to know if HUD is using Trump's stablecoin, how they choose the stablecoin and what fees are being paid into the president's pocket."

GENIUS Act

While the House moves forward on the Clarity Act, the Senate is nearing a potential final vote this week on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025" (GENIUS) Act, which would erect guardrails for the issuance of U.S. stablecoins, the dollar-based tokens that underpin a wide swath of crypto trading.

Majority Leader John Thune, the Senate's top Republican who has recently joined the effort to push forward the stablecoin legislation, made a procedural move on Monday to soon advance to a final vote. Industry insiders are preparing for a vote as soon as Wednesday.

Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst at TD Cowen, said in a note to clients that Thune's move meant a "limit what amendments can be considered before a final vote on the package," including making it difficult for the backers of unrelated credit-card legislation to use the stablecoin bill as leverage to force consideration of their own effort. That was one of the final potential roadblocks to Senate advancement on the bill, which has already drawn strong bipartisan votes as it moved through the process in that chamber of Congress.

The legislation's sponsor, Senator Bill Hagerty, had made it clear that the bill faces a very tight window for adoption this year, considering what else is on the Senate's plate. The GENIUS Act was on the Senate's floor agenda for Tuesday, with a 2:30 p.m. amendment deadline.

If the GENIUS Act passes the Senate, it'll head to the House, where a similar stablecoin bill already awaits, having cleared its committee hurdles. At that point, lawmakers will have to decide their strategy on how to proceed, whether to include the stablecoin matter alongside the market structure bill as a single package, whether the House can just take up the Senate's bill as written or whether the House will seek to hash out its own version.

Negative Rates Return to Switzerland as U.S. Faces Higher Yields. What Does it Mean for Bitcoin?

https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/11/negative-rates-are-back-in-switzerland-as-u-s-faces-higher-bond-yields-what-does-it-mean-for-bitcoin

### 본문
The divergence in bond yields likely represents the perceived effects of Trump's trade war and could bode well for bitcoin.

As President Donald Trump's trade war threatens to upend the global economy, an interesting divergence has emerged that could potentially grease the bitcoin BTC$109,626.49 bull run.

The divergence in consideration is the elevated yields on U.S. Treasury notes that threaten to compound the fiscal issues, and the renewed negative flip in yields on Swiss government bonds.

According to data source Investing.com, Swiss government bonds with maturities of up to five years offered negative yields at press time, with the two-year yield at -17.8 basis points. On the contrary, similar-duration Treasury notes offered yields over 4%.

The divergence is the bond market's way of telling us that the trade war will have different impacts on various countries, depending on their trade profiles.

Those running trade surpluses, such as several European countries and China, will face disinflation or an outright deflation, while countries like the U.S., which import more than they export, will see an increase in price pressures.

The specter of deflation in European nations and China could put pressure on their central banks to ease monetary policy aggressively, likely leading to increased capital deployment into alternative investments like bitcoin. Both the Swiss National Bank and the European Central Bank have already cut rates in recent months.

Meanwhile, analysts have said that higher yields in the U.S. and the record public debt could accelerate the shift away from U.S. assets and into alternative assets.

"The last time this happened [Swiss yields turned negative in late 2019], it preceded coordinated global easing, repo market seizures, and ultimately pandemic-era QE. Now, it likely reflects a mix of deflationary pressure, eurozone contagion risks, and capital rotating into monetary sovereignty safe havens amid sovereign stress elsewhere," pseudonymous analyst EndGame Macro said on X.

It's worth noting that bitcoin's 2020-2021 bull run from $5,000 to over $60,000 was characterized by a record amount of negative-yielding government debt worldwide.

U.K. Regulator Names Sarah Pritchard as Deputy CEO to Help Oversee Crypto, Stablecoins

Pritchard's elevation is a sign of the FCA's focus on developing a comprehensive regulatory environment for the industry.

The U.K.'s financial services regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), appointed a deputy chief executive for the first time, naming Sarah Pritchard to the role as it looks to bolster its oversight of the crypto and digital assets industry.

"The new role has been created to reflect the FCA’s expanding remit, with … regulation of stablecoin and crypto firms as well as buy now pay later activities," the FCA said on Tuesday.

The country's regulatory regime trails that of the nearby European Union, which already has a transnational licensing framework in place with its Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations. The FCA, which currently certifies that companies on its crypto register comply with anti-money laundering rules, is in the process of creating a more comprehensive regime for the sector. It has said it plans to start authorizing crypto firms along the lines of its approach to traditional finance companies by 2026.

Pritchard's role will include an international element, the FCA said. “The international environment is complex, our remit is growing and expectations of us continue to evolve," Ashley Alder, chair of the FCA, said.

Pritchard was previously an executive director of the agency, helping with supervision and policy oversight. The FCA wants to work with the crypto industry to develop regulation for the sector, she said last year. Since then, it has circulated a number of discussion papers on digital assets and stablecoins for its regulatory program.

She will work alongside CEO Nikhil Rathi, who was reappointed in April another five years, and David Geale, a permanent executive director for payments and digital finance.

Ether More Favored by Traders as Volatility Against Bitcoin Hits Highest Since FTX Crash

### 본문
ETH call options are trading at a higher premium on Deribit, making it more favorable to traders.

Ethereum's ether ETH$2,794.04 token, which has been in the shadows of bitcoin BTC$109,626.49 for a long time, is now becoming the new favorite.

Data from TradingView shows that the spread between Volmex's annualized 30-day ether implied volatility index (EVIV) and bitcoin's 30-day index (BVIV) has jumped to 34%, the highest since November 2022. Back then, the FTX exchange went bust, destroying billions in investor wealth.

The widening spread indicates that the market expects significantly larger price swings for ether, and perhaps the broader crypto market, compared to bitcoin in the coming weeks.

Ether has recently outshone bitcoin in terms of price gains, largely due to renewed institutional interest in the cryptocurrency. Notably, in the past 24 hours, ether has risen 8% to $2,728, outperforming almost every major cryptocurrency, including market leader bitcoin, which has gained just 1%, CoinDesk data show.

"Ethereum is pumping up with new money. Over the past two weeks, Ethereum ETFs have attracted $812 million, the biggest amount since the beginning of this year," Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at The FxPro said in an email.

While inflows into the ether spot ETFs have picked up pace, BTC ETFs have managed to draw in less than $400 million in the past two weeks, according to data source SoSoValue.

According to the Singapore-based trading firm QCP, several factors have aligned in favor of the ether bulls.

"Looking ahead, macro tailwinds are aligning for ETH. With the GENIUS Act advancing in the US Senate, Circle’s IPO discussions resurfacing, and stablecoins gaining regulatory traction, Ethereum’s native role in tokenization and settlement rails may be primed for outsized structural upside," QCP said in a market update.

The bias for ether is also evident from the fact that on options exchange Deribit, ETH call options are trading at a premium of at least 2% to 3% relative to puts out to the March 2027 expiry. On the contrary, BTC calls are trading at 0.5%-1.5% premium, according to data source Amberdata.

In other words, traders are paying more for the upside exposure in ether compared to bitcoin.

"ETH options markets have surged with 30-day call-skew hitting 6.24% and funding rates spiking to 0.009%, while the term structure of volatility has reinverted once more," analytics firm Block Scholes said in its daily report.

DeFi Leader Aave Debuts on Sony-Backed Soneium Blockchain

The deal will include Aave’s participation in upcoming liquidity incentive campaigns, including with the Astar, a blockchain prominent in the Japanese Web3 ecosystem.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) firm Aave is arriving on Soneium, the Ethereum L2 blockchain linked to Japanese electronics giant Sony, the companies said on Tuesday.

Decentralized finance, which shot to prominence during the so-called “DeFi summer” of 2020, is resurgent, amid a huge growth in stablecoins and crypto-backed lending. The integration of GHO, Aave’s decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin, into Sonieum is being explored for real-world use cases in payments, savings, and digital commerce, according to a press release.

Soneium’s 7-million user ecosystem already includes Uniswap v4, Velodrome, Stargate, Lido, and native protocols like Kyo Finance and SuperVol.

“Aave wants to be where consumers are, in trusted, accessible environments,” said Aave Labs Founder Stani Kulechov in a statement. “Sony’s global reputation and Soneium’s focus on consumer-facing applications make this a unique opportunity for Aave to reach new mainstream users.”

The partnering will include Aave’s participation in upcoming liquidity incentive campaigns, including with the Astar, a blockchain prominent in the Japanese Web3 ecosystem, and a 100 million ASTR allocation (currently valued at $4M) to bootstrap adoption, according to a press release.

Soneium, which this week announced a new gaming incubator to help drive more traffic to the blockchain, is developed by Sony Block Solutions Labs, a joint venture between Sony Group and Startale Group.

The $0.70 level is a key psychological support zone for ADA's price stability, CoinDesk Research's technical analysis shows.

Cardano's native token ADA ADA$0.71710 added 3% in the past 24 hours after Nasdaq said it  expanded its crypto benchmark index from five to nine assets, adding ADA alongside XRP XRP$2.30, Solana SOL$167.04 and Stellar XLM$0.28092.

ADA experienced significant price volatility overnight, establishing a 8.8% trading range between $0.66 and $0.72, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis. It was recently trading at $0.6951.

Trading volumes for ADA have increased 68% over the past 24 hours, suggesting active market participation despite uncertain conditions. Its addition to the Nasdaq index could significantly increase Cardano's visibility among traditional investors.

Market analysts note the $0.70 level has emerged as a crucial psychological support zone that will likely determine ADA's short-term trajectory following its earlier bullish momentum.

The CoinDesk 20 Index, which tracks the broader crypto market performance, is up about 4% over the past 24 hours.

Don’t Let the Cult of Price Hold Crypto Back

### 링크
https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/06/10/dont-let-the-cult-of-price-hold-crypto-back

### 본문
Focusing solely on prices masks the real progress taking place on blockchains like Ethereum, says William Mougayar, founder of the Ethereum Market Research Centre.

Cryptocurrency is too often viewed through the narrow lens of price. The dominant narrative surrounding Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader crypto market has become fixated on one idea: numbers go up. Did Bitcoin break $100,000? Did Ethereum double in a month? Is this altcoin going to the moon?

Financial media, X pundits, and even crypto advocates routinely reduce an entire technological revolution to a speculative race to ever-higher prices. But this is like evaluating Apple or Nvidia solely by their stock movements while ignoring the iPhone or the GPUs powering AI infrastructure. It’s a superficial way of thinking — and in crypto, it’s also dangerous.

In traditional markets, value is ultimately grounded in usage. The more products a company sells, the more revenue it generates. The more users it retains, the stronger its network effect. Apple isn’t a $3 trillion company just because its stock price went up; it’s because over a billion people use its ecosystem daily. Nvidia didn’t become a Wall Street darling by sheer momentum; it built the most essential chips of the AI age. Stock price follows product-market fit. In crypto, this principle is often inverted — price comes first, and everything else becomes secondary or optional.

Nowhere is this philosophy more deeply ingrained than in what might be called Saylorism — the ideology promoted by MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, the loudest evangelist for Bitcoin-as-collateral. Under this worldview, the core utility of Bitcoin isn’t transacting, building, or innovating — it’s simply holding. You buy Bitcoin, never sell, borrow against it, repeat. The usage is the hoarding.

Bitcoin is not a currency or platform under Saylorism — it’s a speculative vault for value, designed to appreciate forever and justify more borrowing. In essence, every company becomes a leveraged Bitcoin fund, building its capital structure around a single bet: that the number always goes up.

This is a radical departure from the logic that underpins healthy businesses. Traditional firms grow by creating value for others, through products, services, and infrastructure. Under Saylorism, value is internalized, circular, and ultimately recursive: you buy more Bitcoin because it’s going up, which makes it go up, which justifies buying more. It resembles a corporate Ponzi mindset, not in legal terms, but in structural dynamics, where external adoption matters less than internal leverage. The market doesn’t need new users, it just needs existing holders to keep believing.

Compare that to Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, which has taken a different path. While Ethereum is also subject to the gravitational pull of price speculation, and no one would argue that “number goes up” doesn’t matter; its value proposition is fundamentally rooted in usage. ETH is not just a store of value; it is the fuel of an economy. It powers decentralized applications, settles billions in stablecoin transactions, tokenizes real-world assets, mints NFTs, facilitates decentralized finance, and supports governance. ETH has demand because the network has demand. The more people use Ethereum, the more ETH is needed. And the more ETH is burned through transaction fees, the more supply becomes constrained. Price here reflects activity, not just belief.

This distinction is profound. Ethereum’s growth is tied to its functionality, to what it enables for users and developers. It resembles a traditional business more than a vault. It’s like Amazon in the early 2000s: difficult to value by conventional metrics but serving a growing ecosystem.

The difference between these two models–Bitcoin as gold and Ethereum as infrastructure–has sparked endless debate over whether they’re even in competition. Some argue they’re entirely different species: Bitcoin is a monetary metal; Ethereum is a decentralized world computer, perhaps likened to digital oil.

It’s fair to ask: what’s ultimately more valuable, the gold you keep or the dollar you spend? Bitcoin’s value depends on people holding it. Ethereum’s value depends on people using it. Both are succeeding, but the paths are not the same.

If cryptocurrency is to evolve beyond its speculative adolescence, it must shift away from price obsession and toward utility obsession. This means asking harder questions: What is this protocol used for? Who depends on it? What problem does it solve? Valuation must come from participation, not just price action. A blockchain that delivers real-world utility for finance, identity, coordination, or computation deserves appreciation. But it must earn it through adoption, not ideology.

What if, instead of competing, Bitcoin and Ethereum found common ground and worked together?

That’s where the opportunity emerges: Ethereum serves as the most robust gateway for Bitcoin holders looking to access the broader world of decentralized finance. No network rivals Ethereum in terms of DeFi’s depth and maturity. By converting BTC into Ethereum-compatible assets, holders can engage in a dynamic ecosystem of lending, staking, and yield generation, turning dormant Bitcoin into active, value-producing capital. Platforms like Aave, Lido, Ethena, ether.fi, and Maker enable BTC to participate in ways that static holding simply can’t.

The outcome?

Mutual benefit: Ethereum attracts more liquidity, while Bitcoin gains much-needed utility. It’s a powerful synergy that amplifies the strengths of both networks.

Cryptocurrency is not just a dumb financial asset It’s programmable money, digital property, frictionless transactions, decentralized coordination, and trustless finance. It’s a reimagining of the internet’s economic layer. But its long-term success depends on moving past the dopamine of daily price charts. Because in the end, the most valuable technologies aren’t the ones with the flashiest tickers; they’re the ones that get used.

And usage, not hoarding, is what builds lasting value.

Market observers heralded the SEC Chair Atkins' comments as positive development for the sector, with Binance founder CZ saying that June 9th "will be remembered as DeFi day."

Decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens UNI, AAVE and SKY all rose by more than 20% on optimistic comments from SEC Chair Paul Atkins at a Monday roundtable discussion about the sector.

Atkins instructed the regulator to explore exemptions to let decentralized finance (DeFi) firms conduct operations without as many restrictions.

"The right to have self-custody of one's private property is a foundational American value," he said.

The comments are a stark contrast to those made by the previous commission led by Gary Gensler, which was criticized for stifling innovation by imposing restrictive guidance on crypto firms.

"Can you imagine a starker contrast with the previous SEC’s approach?," said Noelle Acheson, analyst and author of Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter.

"We expected Atkins to say some nice words around the potential for innovation to unleash new financial efficiencies," she wrote. "We didn’t expect his support to be quite so emphatic."

Industry members heralded the event as a symbolic milestone the event ,

June 9th "will be remembered as DeFi day," Changpeng "CZ" Zhao, founder of Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume posted on X.

"The DeFi Renaissance continues," said Arthur Cheong, founder and CEO of crypto investment firm DeFiance Capital.

DeFi-related tokens well outperformed an already upbeat crypto market with bitcoin BTC$109,626.49 bouncing to near record prices. Ethereum's ether ETH$2,794.04, a key hub for DeFi applications, also jumped over 8%.

The broad-market crypto benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index was 4.7% up over the past 24 hours, while BTC gained 1.5% in the same period.

Why Is Web3 Losing the AI Race?

### 링크
https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/06/10/why-is-web3-losing-the-ai-race

### 본문
The Web3-AI movement is short on talent, data, compute, infrastructure and capital and risks becoming an afterthought to the centralized ecosystem, says Jesus Rodriguez.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely regarded as one of the most transformative technologies of this century. Naturally, the prospect of decentralized AI systems powered by Web3 infrastructure holds significant conceptual appeal.

However, despite this seemingly compelling value proposition, Web3-AI has failed to achieve meaningful traction in the broader AI ecosystem. As frontier AI capabilities accelerate at unprecedented rates, the window of opportunity for Web3 to become a viable foundation for next-generation AI is rapidly closing.

This essay explores a controversial but critical thesis: Web3 is losing the AI race. There comes a point in every technological revolution when it becomes too late to mount a credible disruption. If Web3-AI doesn’t shift focus from superficial trends to foundational infrastructure, the rationale for building the next generation of AI systems on decentralized platforms may disappear entirely.

The Web3 AI Narrative Fallacy

In "The Black Swan," Nassim Nicholas Taleb introduced the concept of the "narrative fallacy": the tendency to construct coherent stories around unrelated or weakly connected events. The current state of Web3-AI is a textbook example. The community rewards highly performative but largely irrelevant trends in the context of the AI market—AI meme agents, speculative zk-AI prototypes—as if they mark substantial progress in the field. While some innovation exists, the widening gulf between Web3-AI and the broader AI ecosystem is becoming unsustainable.

The allure of narrative-driven innovation has encouraged the Web3 ecosystem to mistake experimentation for progress. As a result, capital and attention are often misallocated to novelty rather than foundational capability. The illusion of momentum is masking the fact that most of what is being built today in Web3-AI is orthogonal to the critical path of AI innovation.

AI and the Wave Theory of Tech Evolution

To understand Web3-AI’s fragile position, it’s helpful to look at how technology tends to evolve. First, breakthroughs tend to unfold in interdependent waves. For example, mobile computing was catalyzed by prior waves like cloud infrastructure, and AI chips emerged from innovations in gaming hardware. To remain relevant in a new wave, technologies must be grounded in previous ones.

Web3-AI lacks that continuity. It did not play a meaningful role in the trends that gave rise to the generative AI revolution. It missed the cycles of cloud computing, large-scale data engineering, and even early AI model development. As a result, Web3-AI suffers from a foundational vacuum—it is trying to ride a wave without a surfboard.

Second, infrastructure technology markets tend to consolidate. History shows that dominant infrastructure platforms almost always shrink to a few major players. Cloud computing converged around AWS, Azure and GCP. Mobile development stabilized around iOS and Android. Big data coalesced around Snowflake and Databricks. AI infrastructure will likely follow a similar pattern. If Web3-AI doesn’t position itself as one of the top three viable platforms, it risks becoming irrelevant in a highly concentrated landscape.

Missing Fundamentals and Building Irrelevant Things

The modern AI stack is built on four fundamental pillars: data, compute, models, and research talent. Unfortunately, Web3 has historically ignored all four. It lacks deep AI talent. There are no large-scale AI datasets native to Web3. Compute infrastructure is still primitive. And, there are no widely adopted AI models running meaningfully on decentralized protocols.

This lack of fundamentals is compounded by a tendency to chase shiny objects. Projects in Web3-AI disproportionately gravitate toward speculative areas like meme agents or zkML without clear use cases. While these ideas are intellectually interesting, they are not core to enabling or scaling meaningful AI capabilities. In their current form, they offer little practical value for advancing AI infrastructure.

To make real progress, the Web3-AI ecosystem must confront this foundational deficit. That means investing in talent, building data pipelines, creating efficient compute layers, and developing models that offer tangible advantages when deployed on decentralized systems.

The AI Gap Between Web3 and Web2 is Increasing

AI innovation is compounding rapidly, and Web3 has been a passive observer. None of the major AI milestones—unsupervised pretraining, advanced fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation, reasoning engines, or agentic frameworks—have involved Web3 architectures in a meaningful way.

As each new release compounds on the last, the barriers to catching up become steeper. All critical tooling, platforms, and infrastructure for building frontier models are currently centralized. Without urgent, coordinated efforts to change this trajectory, Web3-AI will be left decades behind in a field that advances in months.

The Risk of Irrelevance

AI is, by its very nature, a centralizing force. Training frontier models requires vast datasets, enormous compute, and specialized talent—all of which trend toward concentration. Decentralized alternatives face deep technical and economic challenges.

This does not mean decentralized AI is doomed. But the margin for error is vanishing. Unless Web3-AI accelerates dramatically, the centralized ecosystem will reach such dominance that decentralization becomes an afterthought. The risk is not missing out on the next AI trend; it is becoming fundamentally irrelevant in the AI future.

A Wake-Up Call

Resilience and optimism are embedded in Web3’s DNA, and recent efforts by more technically serious teams are encouraging such as Nous Research( distributed training), Prime Intellect( distributed training), LayerLens( benchmarking and evals), Pluralis( distributed training), Sahara (AI apps)and a handful of others. Some are starting to tackle core problems—privacy-preserving ML, distributed training, verifiable inference.

But these efforts remain exceptions rather than the norm. The Web3-AI movement is still short on talent, data, compute, infrastructure, and capital. It must abandon distractions and orient toward foundational capability. Facing this reality with clarity offers a chance to change course. Ignoring it means missing out on the most consequential technological revolution in history.

South Korea's Ruling Party Wants to Allow Companies to Issue Stablecoins: Bloomberg

### 본문
Under a proposed law, companies would be able issue their own tokens provided they meet equity capital requirements and can guarantee refunds through reserves.

South Korean President Lee Jae-myung's Democratic Party submitted a bill to parliament that would allow qualifying companies to issue stablecoins, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.

The Digital Asset Basic Act is aimed at improving transparency and encouraging competition in cryptocurrency, Bloomberg said. Companies would be able to issue their own stablecoins provided they have at least 500 million won ($368,000) in equity capital and can guarantee refunds through reserves as well as receiving approval from the Financial Services Commission.

Lee, voted in as president last week, made a number of promises to South Korea's crypto industry during his election campaign, appealing to the nation's 15 million crypto investors. Among them, he said the country should support a won-based stablecoin market "to prevent national wealth from leaking overseas," the Korea Herald reported.

Stablecoins are tokens pegged to the value of a traditional financial asset, such as a fiat currency, with the U.S. dollar being comfortably the most prevalent. Their stability provides a counterweight to the volatility of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin BTC$109,626.49 and ether ETH$2,794.04, allowing users to hold capital in digital assets without having to worry about wild swings in price.

The sector, which is dominated by Tether's USDT, has experienced a surge in interest this year thanks to, among other factors, progress toward regulation of the sector in the U.S.

The strength of the stablecoin sector has been highlighted in the last week by the strong performance of USDC issuer Circle's stock (CRCL) following its initial public offering (IPO). The shares more than quadrupled during the first three days of trading. In addition, market cap of the sector reached $250 billion for the first time.

Growing Stacks of Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Signals Bullish Outlook

### 링크

### 본문
As the bitcoin counts of long-term holders has increased, that of short-term holders has fallen.

Long-term holder (LTH) bitcoin supply, as tracked by Glassnode, has surged to a record 14.46 million BTC, signaling confidence that price gains are in store.

LTHs, defined as investors holding bitcoin BTC$109,626.49 for at least 155 days, are often seen as "smart money," strategically buying during price dips and selling during bull market peaks. This all-time high in LTH supply suggests that seasoned investors anticipate higher prices, a pattern historically associated with significant price rallies.

From March to June, LTH supply increased by approximately 500,000 BTC, while short-term holders (STHs) sold around 350,000 BTC

Many investors now classified as LTH entered the market amid the euphoria of January's Trump inauguration and $109,000 record. Five months later, having endured a 30% correction and now the bounce back to a record, these LTH's are demonstrating resilience.

LTHs currently represent about 73% of bitcoin’s circulating supply of 19.88 million BTC, underscoring their dominance in the market. This concentration of bitcoin in long-term hands, suggests potential for further price upside.

### 본문
The crypto exchange surveyed Fortune 500 company execs and decision makers at small and medium-sized firms in the U.S. to assess crypto adoption trends.

The future of money has arrived, with 60% of Fortune 500 companies actively working on blockchain initiatives, digital asset exchange Coinbase (COIN) said in its second quarter State of Crypto report published Tuesday.

Stablecoin usage is exploding with a 54% growth in supply year-on-year, more than one third of small and medium sized businesses (SMB) are using crypto, and 60% of Fortune 500 companies are working on blockchain projects, the report said.

Adoption is expected to continue to grow. Twenty percent of Fortune 500 executives said that onchain initiatives were a key part of their company's strategy moving forward, and more than 80% of institutional investors plan to increase their exposure to crypto this year.

Forty-six percent of small and medium businesses who don't use crypto are planning to start using it in the next three years, the report said, and 82% of these companies were of the view that usage of this technology could help address some of their "financial pain points."

Still, for crypto to reach its full potential, greater regulatory clarity is needed. 90% of F500 execs surveyed said that clear crypto regulation in the U.S. is needed to support innovation.

Coinbase used third-party research firms to survey 100 Fortune 500 executives about their adoption of Web3, and 251 decision-makers at small and medium-sized businesses in April. It also analysed web3 initiative activity by Fortune 100 companies between 2020 and 2025.

### 본문
<p>Analysis of search data and student survey responses by the Keystone Education Group has revealed continuing “robust” interest in the UK, despite concerns that the government’s immigration white paper would hamper attractiveness.  </p>



<p>“We’re still seeing substantial year-on-year growth in the UK’s ‘share of search,’ reflecting the relative appeal of the UK in a turbulent international study environment,” Mark Bennett, Keystone vice president of research &amp; insight, told <em>The PIE News.</em> </p>



<p>“Relative search interest for the UK is still up more than 50% [on the previous year] since the proposals were made,” added Bennett, with data based on active search behaviour of thousands of users. &nbsp;</p>



<p></p>

<p>The highly anticipated <a href="https://thepienews.com/uk-immigration-white-paper-to-overhaul-english-language-requirements/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">white paper</a>, released on May 12, proposed cutting the graduate route from 24 to 18 months and raising <a href="https://thepienews.com/uk-immigration-white-paper-to-overhaul-english-language-requirements/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">English language requirements</a> for dependants and skilled workers.  </p>



<p>What&#8217;s more, its plans to implement stricter compliance metrics for universities and introduce a<a href="https://thepienews.com/uk-reforms-to-begin-within-weeks-but-student-levy-requires-legislation/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"> 6% levy</a> on institutions’ income from international students, have <a href="https://thepienews.com/uk-sector-hits-out-at-deeply-controversial-international-income-levy/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">alarmed institutions</a>, which the government expect to pass on the levy to students as increased tuition fees.   </p>



<p>And yet, until the plans are implemented, the proposals are “a matter of optics,” said Bennett, maintaining that institutions won’t necessarily increase international fees, and reassuring students that English language requirement increases do not apply to them.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>There isn’t another rabbit coming out of the hat &#8230; the UK has set out what it’s going to do</p>
<cite>Mark Bennett, Keystone</cite></blockquote>



<p>“How students understand and react to these plans will be very important – including appreciating that, for now, they&nbsp;are&nbsp;just plans,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to the graduate route, 42% of prospective master’s students surveyed by Keystone said the shortened route would make “no difference” to their study plans, with just 21% saying they would be “much less likely” to consider the UK.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-252771" height="752" src="https://thepienews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-10-at-10.11.11-1024x752.png" width="1024" /></figure>



<p>While awareness has presumably increased, less than half of the 400 students initially surveyed were aware of the Graduate Route changes. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In a world where negative news tends to travel quickly among international audiences, the fact that the proposals weren’t rapidly picked up by students suggests it may not be critical, said Keystone. &nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Bennett, limiting the Graduate Route was the “least worst” change that the government could have made, with <a href="https://thepienews.com/speculation-rife-that-uks-graduate-route-may-be-tied-to-professional-roles-only/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">concerns circulating</a> prior to its publication that the white paper would tie graduate visas to skills-based jobs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, although the UK’s offering to international students is worse than it was two years ago, as policy restrictions dominate other major markets, Keystone’s data indicates that the UK is being perceived as a relatively stable choice. </p>



<p>“There isn’t another rabbit coming out of the hat&#8230; the UK has set out what it’s going to do,” said Bennett, highlighting Canada’s <a href="https://thepienews.com/canadian-study-permit-approvals-fall-far-below-cap-targets/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">study permit caps</a>, fears that <a href="https://thepienews.com/scant-comfort-for-our-sector-in-australian-election-results/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Australia</a> will follow suit, and a US policy environment that is “almost <a href="https://thepienews.com/us-trump-pauses-new-student-visa-interviews/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">impossible to predict</a>”. </p>

### 본문
<p>Poised to start in September, the program – created in partnership with the <a href="https://iofacademy.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Institute of Football Academy</a> (IOF Academy) – will offer domestic and international students aged 13-19 the chance to combine top-tier academics with professional-level football training. </p>



<p>Participants will follow a dual pathway, balancing rigorous academic qualifications – including GCSEs, A-Levels, and the NCUK Foundation qualifications – with advanced football coaching through a tailored player development curriculum.</p>



<p>As part of the experience, <a href="https://www.abbotsholme.co.uk/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Abbotsholme School</a> students can work towards official FA coaching and scouting certifications, opening doors to careers in football on and off the pitch, including roles in coaching, scouting, sports science, media, and more. The program will also provide expert guidance and preparation for US university sports scholarship placements.  </p>



<p>The IOF Academy, co-founded in 2007, has helped over 100 players sign with professional clubs and supported over 1,000 players in securing soccer scholarships at top universities in the <a href="https://thepienews.com/countries/usa/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">US</a> and beyond. </p>



<p>Russ Hullett, IOF Academy co-founder as well as a former coach and scout for major clubs including Manchester United and Aston Villa, said: &#8220;We’re committed to delivering a professional academy-style experience for every player. </p>



<p>&#8220;This program is about creating real opportunities, whether you&#8217;re dreaming of a career on the field or aiming to thrive in the global sports industry.&#8221;</p>

Explained: What is the average UK study visa refusal rate?

### 링크
https://thepienews.com/visa-refusals-study-in-uk/

### 본문
<p>The UK government’s recent <a href="https://thepienews.com/breaking-uk-graduate-route-reduced-to-18-months-under-immigration-white-paper/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">immigration white paper</a> laid out a number of changes for UK institutions, including changes to compliance metrics.</p>



<p>⁠It proposes to raise the minimum pass requirement of each Basic Compliance Assessment (BCA) metric – which all institutions must meet – by five percentage points. Under the plans, a sponsor would have to maintain a course enrolment rate of at least 95% and a course completion rate of 90% in order to pass the compliance threshold.</p>



<p>A traffic-light system of green, amber, red will be created to publicly identify which universities are in breach of their sponsor licence – with red signalling a major breach. </p>



<p>Of all the mooted changes laid out in the white paper, this is the one that is making UK stakeholders the most uneasy. After all, no one wants see their university get a dreaded &#8216;red&#8217; rating.</p>



<p>This sense of trepidation is largely down to to the myriad factors beyond institutions&#8217; control that affect whether prospective students&#8217; visas are accepted – with all the knock-on effects on their compliance rating that this entails. </p>



<p>While institutions do vet international applicants before they are accepted onto programs, their visa could nevertheless be rejected due to documentation errors, Home Office decisions or – rarely – <a href="https://thepienews.com/secret-io-uk-border-force-special/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">decisions at the UK border</a>.</p>



<p>So is the sector right to be worried? While there is no publicly available information on the average refusal rate for each higher education institution in the UK, the latest available <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/immigration-system-statistics-data-tables#asylum" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Home Office figures</a> show that the vast majority of study visa applications are accepted – with a refusal rate of roughly 4% in 2024 and 2023. </p>



<p><strong>OK, so it&#8217;s a bit tight – but that would mean most insitutions would be within the 5% threshold, right?</strong></p>



<p>Well, not exactly. It may look as though, even if nothing changes, the average study visa refusal rate would mean that most institutions would be (just) within the 5% refusal threshold, but that&#8217;s not quite how it works.</p>



<p>While the average refusal rate gives a view of the sector overall, it doesn&#8217;t show how the rate differs across the sector, nor the reasons why. For example, some institutions may have an almost non-existent visa rate for any number of reasons – such as recruiting only a small number of international students, or accepting applications mainly from countries with high rates of visa acceptance.</p>



<p>Conversely, having a higher refusal rate doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that institutions are recruiting recklessly, and could instead show that they are offering places to students from countries with traditionally high visa refusal rates.</p>



<p>The refusal rate also differs depending on the time of year the visa application is made – with the smaller number of prospective students applying in Q1 much more likely to be refused than the majority of people who apply in the third quarter of the year. </p>



<p><strong>Tell me more&#8230;</strong></p>



<p>In the first quarter of 2025, some 7,006 student visa applications were rejected, out of a total of 62,21 – a refusal rate of 11%. While this may seem high, rates for the first quarter of the year are generally higher, with a 12% visa refusal rate for the same period in 2024, according to data from <a href="https://www.applyboard.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">ApplyBoard</a>.</p>



<p>Refusal rates are also staying the same, despite an uptick in applications. Per ApplyBoard data, the number of UK visas issued in the first quarter of 2025 was 48,000 – up 27% year-on-year. But, crucially, the grant rate was 88% in both periods, showing an increased demand for student visas rather than any change to acceptance rates.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Q1&#8230; sees fewer applications, often from countries with historically higher refusal rates, while Q3 aligns with the main academic intake, where documentation tends to be stronger<br /><strong><sup><sub>Saskia Johnston, Sable International</sub></sup></strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The majority of student visa applications are made in the third quarter of each year, with this cohort generally having a very low refusal rate.</p>



<p>According to Saskia Johnston, client services director at Sable International – a London-based immigration consultancy – said the discrepancies marked &#8220;both seasonal trends and systemic pressures&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Q1, covering January to March, sees fewer applications, often from countries with historically higher refusal rates, while Q3 aligns with the main academic intake, where documentation tends to be stronger and UKVI operates at full capacity,&#8221; she told <em>The PIE News</em>.</p>



<p>Johnston added that visa refusal rates are driven by a number of interconnected factors, such as challenges verifying financial documents from some countries, and economic instability in source countries, as well as tighter immigration rules brought in over recent years. </p>



<p>&#8220;These shifts are reshaping international student mobility to the UK,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p><strong>But how does the visa refusal rate change according to nationality?</strong></p>



<p>An ApplyBoard analysis comparing data between Q1 2024 and the same period in 2025  gives a fascinating insight into changing study visa refusal rates by nationality. While some key markets, such as India, Nigeria and Ghana, are seeing year-on-year increases in grant rates, whereas other countries such as Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh are all seeing issuance rates fall.</p>



<p>Key takeaways for Q1 2025 include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>India saw a 96% grant rate (up five percentage points year on year).<br /></li>



<li>Nigeria also saw a 96% grant rate (up seven percentage points year on year).<br /></li>



<li>Sri Lanka saw its grant rate rise to 91% (up 16 percentage points year on year).<br /></li>



<li>Ghana saw an 88% grant rate (up 12 percentage points year on year).<br /></li>



<li>Pakistan, meanwhile, saw its grant rate drop to to 74% (down eight percentage points year on year).<br /></li>



<li>Nepal saw its grant rate fall to 84% (down 14 percentage points year on year).<br /></li>



<li>Bangladesh saw its grant drop to 63% (down 15 percentage points year on year).<br /></li>

<p><strong>Introduce yourself in three words or phrases.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Higher education enthusiast. Student enabler.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What do you like most about your job?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>I love interacting with students, I get infected by their energy, which reeks of the aspiration to study abroad, explore new destinations, and explore new challenges in their lives. I love that I can make their journeys and experiences more convenient, and enable their dreams so they don’t have to downsize their dreams of studying abroad. Not letting any deserving student fall short on finances is what I’m really passionate about.  </p>



<p><strong>Best work trip?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>I really love New York – the place has a good vibe, for sure. I was there just last week and I met lots of Indian students at different universities: Columbia, SUNY Buffalo, NJIT, Pace University, NYU&#8230; a real range.  </p>



<p><strong>If you could learn a language instantly, which would you pick and why?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Language? If I could understand the language of the heart and understand what people are thinking that would be the best, so then I could understand what expectations people might have from Credila. I would love to make their journeys more convenient and more palatable.  </p>



<p><strong>What makes you get up in the morning?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>My busy schedule and the alarms in my calendar. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Best international ed conference and why?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think NAFSA is amazing. I’ve never seen so many exhibitors or experienced the kind of energy that NAFSA carries. The sheer number of exhibitors overwhelms you, so I believe NAFSA has to be the one. It’s amazing. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Worst conference food/beverage experience?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m a vegetarian, so when I don’t find anything vegetarian, it’s a nightmare for me. I have to survive on bread and cheese. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Book or podcast recommendation for others in the sector?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Naval Ravikant – I simply adore that guy. Amazing guy. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Describe a project or initiative you&#8217;re currently working on that excites you.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are working on the undergraduate segment. So, Credila has been very dominant on the graduate programs. Now we want to focus on the undergraduate side of things, so we’ll reach out to undergraduate applicants in overseas markets. </p>



<p>The second is, we’re also very excited to look at domestic undergraduate segments as well, so UG is something we’re increasingly focussed on now.  </p>
