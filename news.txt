US energy sec floats faster grid access for AI and crypto miners

### 본문
The US Secretary of Energy has urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to write new rules that will make it faster for large electricity consumers, such as AI data centers and Bitcoin mining operations, to directly connect to the power grid.

In a letter released on Thursday, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright asked the FERC, the independent agency that regulates the interstate electricity grid, to grant expedited reviews and create standardized procedures for large electricity users to hook directly into the high-voltage transmission system, not just local power lines.

The high-voltage transmission system has a higher voltage capacity than local lines and is typically used by large industrial facilities that consume power at a higher rate.

“United States electricity demand is expected to grow at an extraordinary pace, due, in large part, to the rapid growth of large loads,” Wright wrote.

“Although there are several drivers to this demand growth, such as home and vehicle electrification, increasing quantities of large commercial and industrial load, most notably data centers, are connecting rapidly to the transmission system.”

Bitcoin miners and AI centers would benefit

S. Matthew Schultz, the CEO of Bitcoin mining company CleanSpark, said in an X post on Friday, that under the rules, FERC would be required to expedite connections for “flexible loads like Bitcoin mining and data centers.”

“This is a major signal that DOE recognizes the value of flexible demand in strengthening the grid,” he said.

Bitcoin miners require significant power to operate their mining rigs, which validate transactions and create new blocks. The more miners participate, the higher the hashrate, which helps secure the network.

Reviews could only take 60 days

Under the new rules, Wright suggests that expedited reviews on whether large power users can connect would be completed in 60 days, instead of years, provided the applicant meets criteria such as agreeing to pay for any network upgrades that might be required.

Wright asks that FERC respond to his letter within the next six months, no later than April 30, 2026.

Bitcoin mining companies and artificial intelligence data centers have been increasingly competing for access to cheap, sustainable energy, which has been suggested could bring in renewed institutional investment over the next decade.

Another ‘Satoshi era’ wallet from 2009 has woken up to move Bitcoin

### 본문
A “Satoshi-era” Bitcoin wallet with $442 million worth of BTC has become the latest sleeping Bitcoin giant to wake, shifting some of its funds for the first time in 14 years.

The unknown owner of the wallet made most of its stash mining 4,000 Bitcoin (BTC) between April and June 2009, only a few months after the first blockchain network went live, Whale Alert said in an X post on Thursday.

Data from the onchain analytics platform Nansen shows the whale sent 150 Bitcoin, worth over $16 million, in a single transaction on Thursday.

On-chain data from the Bitcoin blockchain explorer and analytics platform memepool space suggests the whale may have once held ‎7,850 Bitcoin, and was last active in June 2011 when it consolidated 4,000 Bitcoin into one wallet.

Bitcoin is trading at roughly $110,604 on Friday, which would make the whales’ entire stash worth over $442 million. It was worth $194 in 2010 when CoinMarketCap started tracking the price of Bitcoin in July of that year.

Whale might have had more Bitcoin

Another X user, Emmett Gallic, a self-employed blockchain analyst, said the whale once held 8,000 Bitcoin across multiple wallets and has been steadily selling off its holdings in another address “for years.”

“A Whale that once held 8,000 BTC activated a new wallet from the Satoshi Era of Bitcoin. He has been steadily selling now down to 3850 BTC after moving 150 BTC today. God Level DCA Strat,” he said.

Memepool space shows the whale address has received a total of 7,850 Bitcoin; the  balance shows up as 3,850 BTC after the recent transfer of 150 coins.

OG whales on the move

Another Satoshi-era Bitcoin whale with 80,201 tokens started shifting its holdings to Galaxy Digital after being dormant for 14 years in July, making a final transfer on July 16.

Crypto analyst Willy Woo stated in June that whales with more than 10,000 Bitcoin have been steadily selling since 2017, responding to an X user’s question about who has been selling amid heightened interest from institutions.

Traders sometimes interpret the awakening of old whales as a sign that early holders are considering selling their holdings but analysts told Cointelegraph in August that OG Bitcoiners selling their holdings is nothing to worry about because new buyers are jumping in, which is a good sign of a maturing market.

Australians punch above their weight in crypto interest, data shows

Australians have the highest levels of interest in cryptocurrency per capita, based on their web traffic, with most activity relating to trading and speculation, according to new data.

Data compiled by venture firm Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto division calculated the percentage of web traffic from each country across the top 30 tokens on CoinGecko, filtering out Bitcoin and stablecoins.

Australians had the highest per capita percentage of token-related web traffic at 74.63% per 1 billion people, while South Koreans were a close second with 73.48% of token-related web traffic, while users from the United Kingdom were third with 62.15% per 1 billion people.

Interestingly, the United States lagged as only 40.73% of web traffic went to token-related activities per 1 billion people.

The report also found that crypto users from developed nations gravitated toward trading and speculating, while users from developing nations were more likely to participate in on-chain activity, which was indicated by mobile wallet usage.

Australia’s crypto demand is expected to grow in 2026

The overall Australian crypto market is expected to grow at 19.85% annually, with total revenue reaching 1.2 billion Australian dollars ($780 million) by 2026, according to Statista.

Meanwhile, the Australian crypto user base is expected to reach 11.16 million by 2026, with nearly 41% of Australians participating in crypto.

A survey conducted by Swyftx indicates that 40% of Gen Z and Millennial Australians regret not investing in cryptocurrencies a decade ago.

“A lot of younger investors want high beta assets in their portfolios, and the data we have indicates they generally understand the asset class pretty well,” a Swyftx spokesperson told Cointelegraph.

Bitcoin’s Rally Cools as Traders Hedge the Heat

After months of steady gains, BTC is slipping below key cost-basis levels as long-term holders sell into strength and traders retreat to defensive derivatives.

What to know:

After months of steady rise to record high, bitcoin’s BTC$111,286.26 pulse has slowed, with BTC changing hands above $111,000 Friday afternoon, Hong Kong time, up 2% over the last week according to CoinDesk market data.

The pullback from the recent peak of over $126,000 is marked by momentum faltering below key cost-basis levels, with capital leaving the spot market and ETFs, alongside defensive options positioning.

In a recent report, Glassnode frames the repeated breakdowns below key quantiles as evidence of market exhaustion. At the same time, CryptoQuant, in a note shared with CoinDesk, finds similar stress in shrinking realized profits and drained exchange inflows.

Capital, they both argue, is staying in crypto but rotating from spot to derivatives, with volatility itself now the main traded asset. Until that balance resets, rallies are likely to be faded rather than followed.

Glassnode points to the short-term holders’ cost basis around $113,000 as the dividing line between renewed strength and deeper consolidation. Falling below that threshold, the firm says, signals that recent buyers are now sitting on losses, eroding confidence and forcing weaker hands to capitulate.

Long-term holders, meanwhile, have been selling into strength at a pace exceeding 22,000 BTC per day since July, a trend that continues to sap momentum and weigh on any sustained recovery. If bitcoin fails to reclaim the $113,000 line, Glassnode warns that losses could deepen toward the $108,000–$97,000 range, where 15%–25% of the supply has historically become unprofitable.

CryptoQuant’s data reinforces that view from a flow perspective. ETF inflows have cooled after months of accumulation, while exchange reserves are rising again, a sign that traders are preparing to sell into volatility rather than accumulate.

The firm characterizes this as a rotation of capital within crypto rather than a full exit, as liquidity migrates toward futures and options markets where volatility premiums have surged. This mirrors structural shifts seen in 2021 and mid-2022, when speculative leverage replaced spot conviction.

Options data echo the broader sense of caution. Glassnode reports record-high open interest as traders increasingly rely on derivatives to hedge rather than bet on upside, with put demand rising across maturities.

Glassnode notes that market makers’ hedging has tended to smooth short-term price action, selling into rallies and buying dips to stay delta (market) neutral. Elevated volatility and heavy put demand are keeping the market pinned, with rallies capped by hedging flows rather than broad conviction.

These dynamics have left the market in a limbo, where price action is more shaped by risk management than by directional conviction.

CryptoQuant interprets these flows as a sign of consolidation rather than collapse, writing that liquidity is staying within crypto’s ecosystem, rotating through different instruments as investors wait for clearer macro or policy signals before committing new capital.

Both firms suggest that a meaningful recovery will require renewed spot demand and calmer derivatives activity, conditions that may hinge on the timing of Fed rate cuts or a revival in ETF inflows.

For now, bitcoin isn’t breaking down so much as catching its breath, trading less like a revolution and more like a rotation. Volatility may still be the market’s favorite asset class, but sooner or later, even traders get tired of trading fear.

Swiss Bank Sygnum to Launch Bitcoin-Backed Loan Platform With Multi-Sig Wallet Control

The offering, developed with non-custodial BTC lending startup Debifi, targets institutions and high-net worth borrowers who don't want to give up control of their assets.

What to know:

In this article

LUGANO, SWITZERLAND — Swiss digital asset bank Sygnum Bank has teamed up with bitcoin BTC$109,648.68 lending startup Debifi to launch what they say is the first bank-backed loan platform that doesn’t require borrowers to give up full control of their BTC.

The offering, dubbed MultiSYG and set to open in the first half of 2026, will target institutions and high-net-worth individuals who want access to bank-grade loan services but are wary of rehypothecation, a practice common in traditional finance where lenders reuse client collateral to back other deals.

The move underscores the growing market for digital asset-backed financial products, which has evolved well beyond the early, and failed, crypto lenders like BlockFi and Celsius. Institutional players are increasingly demanding more sophisticated structures, especially those that avoid the single-point-of-failure risks that plagued centralized platforms in the last cycle.

"Borrowers shouldn’t need to trust a custodian blindly," said Debifi CEO Max Kei in a statement, pointing to years of demand for non-custodial lending options.

Most banks offering bitcoin-backed loans typically require full custody, cutting the borrower off from their assets until repayment. With MultiSYG, would-be borrowers can deposit BTC into a wallet controlled by five parties — Sygnum, the borrower and independent signers — with any collateral movement requiring three signatures. That model helps prevent rehypothecation and allows borrowers to verify the existence of their funds onchain throughout the life of the loan.

"[This] combines the best of both worlds — the ability to hold your own keys while accessing regulated banking products and white-glove service," said Pascal Eberle, Bitcoin@Sygnum and MultiSYG initiative lead at Sygnum Bank, in a statement. "Borrowers can benefit from bank-grade terms in pricing, drawdown flexibility and loan duration, while keeping cryptographic proof of their holdings and partial control of their BTC."

How Much Could Bitcoin, Ether, XRP and Solana Move After the U.S. Inflation Report?

The release of September's Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to show a 3.1% rise in the cost of living from a year earlier, the highest in 18 months, according to FactSet.

What to know:

The crypto market, starved of fresh economic data due to the prolonged U.S. government shutdown, will finally get a key data point with the release of September’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Friday.

The inflation figure could trigger larger price swings in ether ETH$3,970.68 than in bitcoin BTC$109,648.68, a store-of-value asset. Overall, however, the expected market volatility is nothing out of the ordinary.

Inflation ticked higher in September

The consumer price index for September, due for release at 12:30 UTC, is expected to show the cost of living rose 3.1% from a year earlier, up from 2.9% in August and the highest in 18 months, according to a survey of economists by data provider FactSet. On a monthly basis, inflation likely rose 0.4%, matching August's pace.

Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, is forecast to have increased by 3.1% for the third straight month, with a monthly gain of 0.3%.

The consensus is that the data, whether it beats or misses expectations, is unlikely to deter the Fed from cutting its benchmark interest rate by another quarter-point next week.

That said, a hotter-than-expected print could bode well for the dollar, according to analysts at ING. A strengthening dollar index may arrest gains in the crypto market.

"We don’t think U.S. CPI will offer that opportunity as we expect a consensus 0.3% MoM core print. But surely with 50bp of easing fully priced in by year-end, any hot print could offer good support to the dollar," ING analysts said in a note Thursday.

Meanwhile, a lower CPI could trigger a risk-on reaction in markets, according to digital asset trading firm Zerocap.

"The U.S. government shutdown has starved keen market analysts of often crucial data, and a drip feed of macro signals in the wake of the crypto pullback two weeks ago means a lower CPI reading could easily stoke bullish sentiment amid an ongoing retail selloff," John Toro, head of trading at Zerocap, said in an email.

Ether to swing 2.9%

According to data from the Deribit-listed options market, ether, the second-largest token by market value, could move by 2.9% following the CPI release, outpacing bitcoin's volatility.

"The options market is currently pricing in a ±1.4% move for Bitcoin following today’s CPI release, while Ethereum is pricing in a larger ±2.9% move," Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, told CoinDesk.

Volmex Finance’s one-day implied volatility indices for Bitcoin and Ether indicate similar expected price fluctuations following the CPI release.

The one-day implied volatility indices for XRP and Solana currently stand at 91% and 76%, respectively, translating to expected price moves of approximately 4.7% for XRP and 4% for Solana within 24 hours.

Bullish volatility?

Importantly, these projected moves are nothing out of the ordinary. They reflect volatility in either direction and do not imply a bullish or bearish market outlook.

That said, Thielen's analysis of key indicators, such as the Stochastic, suggests a potential price bounce in BTC.

"The daily stochastic indicator is showing signs of bullish divergence, even though it has not yet reached its typical 15% lower bound. This suggests that downside momentum may be easing, potentially paving the way for a short-term recovery in bitcoin prices," Thielen said.

Policy uncertainty emerges as top barrier to student mobility

<p>While affordability remains the greatest obstacle for students, IDP Education’s new Emerging Futures <a href="https://partners.idp.com/usa/articles/student-insights/usa-media-release-emerging-futures-8-voice-of-the-international-student" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">survey</a> has revealed the growing impact of sudden and unclear policy changes shaping students’ international study decisions. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Students and families are prepared to make sacrifices to afford their international education dreams. They can adjust budgets, seek scholarships and rely on part-time work. But they cannot plan for uncertainty,” said IDP chief partnerships officer Simon Emmett. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“When the rules change, without warning or clarity, trust falls away. Students hesitate, delay, or choose to study elsewhere.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Drawing on the views of nearly 8,000 international students from 134 countries between July and August 2025, the results highlighted the critical importance of study destinations communicating policy changes to sustain trust among students.  </p>



<p>The US and UK were rated the lowest for providing clear guidance on visas and arrivals processes, while New Zealand was identified as the top communicator in this respect. &nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, the UK saw the steepest rise in students withdrawing from plans to study there, indicating recent policy changes including plans to <a href="https://thepienews.com/shorter-graduate-route-from-january-2027-uk-govt-confirms/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">shorten</a> the Graduate Route and increase compliance metrics for universities are creating uncertainty among international students.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of the students who said they were pivoting away from major study destinations, over half (51%) indicated tuition fees had become unaffordable and one in five said it was too difficult to obtain a visa. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In markets such as Malaysia, the Philippines and the UAE, students reported delaying or redirecting applications almost immediately after unclear announcements by major destinations, the report said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile Canada’s share of withdrawals was shown to have eased, indicating messaging is helping to rebuild stability, the authors suggested, though Canadian study permit issuance has fallen dramatically in 2025. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Without that stability, even the most attractive destinations risk losing trust</p>
<cite>Simon Emmett, IDP</cite></blockquote>



<p>Despite policy disruptions in Australia over recent years, the country remained the most popular first-choice destination globally, ranked highly for value for money, graduate employment opportunities and post-study work pathways. &nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, many respondents flagged sensitivities to recent visa and enrolment changes, highlighting the need for consistent and transparent messaging to maintain Australia’s competitiveness, according to IDP. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The US saw the largest decline in popularity, dropping to third place behind Australia and the UK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NAFSA CEO Fanta Aw said the findings should serve as a “wake-up call” that policy uncertainty has real human and economic costs, emphasising the need for “clear and consistent” communication from institutions and policymakers. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Students are paying close attention to how the US administration handles student visas and post-study experiential learning opportunities like Optional Practical Training,” said Aw.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Visa restrictions and policy hostility have rocked the US under Trump’s second presidency, with global visa appointments <a href="https://thepienews.com/us-trump-pauses-new-student-visa-interviews/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">suspended</a> for nearly a month this summer, as well as thousands of student <a href="https://thepienews.com/data-trumps-student-visa-revocations-in-numbers/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">visa revocations</a> and travel <a href="https://thepienews.com/trump-bans-citizens-of-12-countries-from-entering-us/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">restrictions</a> on 12 nations. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Post-study work opportunities are increasingly fragile in the US with government plans to <a href="https://thepienews.com/trump-plans-overhaul-of-h-1b-visa-favouring-high-paid-workers/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">overhaul</a> the H-1B skilled worker visa to favour better paid jobs and OPT coming under increased <a href="https://thepienews.com/us-senator-calls-for-end-of-opt/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">scrutiny</a> from policymakers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emmett highlighted the knock-on effect of these policy shocks, with student journeys being disrupted “not by ambition, but by uncertainty”. </p>



<p>“Countries that provide predictability will win the confidence of students and their families. Without that stability, even the most attractive destinations risk losing trust,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite financial and political challenges, demand for global study remained strong, with half of all prospective students intending to apply within six months, and a further 29% within a year. </p>



<p>South Asia emerged as the main driver of intent, with more than 60% of students surveyed from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh preparing near-term applications, though this region was also the most sensitive to abrupt or confusing policy shifts. &nbsp;</p>

How Australia, the US, New Zealand and Canada are navigating change

### 본문
<p>Last week, 1,500 delegates gathered in Australia&#8217;s capital city for the 2025 Australian International Education Conference (<a href="https://aiec.idp.com/home" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">AIEC</a>) to tackle the theme of &#8216;navigating change&#8217;. Following a period of heavy policy turmoil, delegates heard from assistant minister for international education Julian Hill that Australia is “open for business&#8221; – albeit with a few <a href="https://thepienews.com/australia-open-for-business-but-integrity-comes-first-says-hill/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">caveats</a>.</p>



<p>But it was a session on competitor market updates that helped put Australia’s own challenges and opportunities into perspective. As Australia settles into a second term under the Albanese government, the Canberra conference heard from the US on just how much elections can shape – and shake – the international education landscape.</p>



<p>Since January 2025, when Donald Trump took office following his <a href="https://thepienews.com/international-education-reacts-to-trump-presidency/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">re-election</a>, the international education sector has witnessed an &#8220;onslaught of policy directives&#8221;, said Fanta Aw, CEO of <a href="https://www.nafsa.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">NAFSA</a>, who said the although some of this was to be expected, the &#8220;fast and furious&#8221; nature of Trump&#8217;s directives has been surprising.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, a White House memo sent to nine top-tier universities <a href="https://thepienews.com/us-moots-15-international-student-cap-on-institutions/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">proposed</a> a 15% cap on colleges’ international undergraduate enrolments, among other demands, in return for preferential access to federal funding.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the sector has seen unprecedented political hostility towards international students from the Trump administration, not least thousands of student&nbsp;<a href="https://thepienews.com/data-trumps-student-visa-revocations-in-numbers/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">visa revocations</a>&nbsp;and attempts to&nbsp;<a href="https://thepienews.com/trumps-student-deportation-campaign-ruled-unconstitutional/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">deport</a>&nbsp;those involved in pro-Palestinian speech, alongside a&nbsp;<a href="https://thepienews.com/trump-bans-citizens-of-12-countries-from-entering-us/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">travel ban</a>&nbsp;on 19 nations, among other challenging policies. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Perhaps most significantly, the administration’s suspension of new visa interviews for nearly a month this summer caused widespread&nbsp;<a href="https://thepienews.com/us-student-visa-scheduling-still-plagued-by-scarcity-and-delays/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">global delays</a>, preventing some students from travelling to the US in time for the fall semester.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Aw, one of the most fundamental concerns for the US sector as a result of policy shifts is the loss of innovation and research opportunities. </p>



<p>Unlike the US, where international students make up around 6% of total enrolments, Canada experienced exponential growth in international student numbers in recent years – growth that stretched capacity and ultimately prompted significant government intervention. For the first time in the country’s history, in January 2024, <a href="https://thepienews.com/canada-caps-study-permits/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a cap</a> was placed on study permits.</p>



<p>&#8220;We didn’t see much of a narrative accompanying that decision – it was sudden, abrupt, followed by 15 or 16 other policy changes,&#8221; said Larissa Bezo, president and CEO of the Canadian Bureau for International Education (<a href="https://cbie.ca/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">CBIE</a>).</p>



<p>In the two years leading up to that policy shift, international student numbers were growing by almost 30% year on year. During the same period, Canada also saw a sharp rise in other temporary resident cohorts, compounding the pressure.</p>



<p>&#8220;One can hardly describe last 1.5 years as a period of stability,&#8221; said Bezo. &#8220;Students around the world looked and drew a conclusion that Canada really closed its doors to students. That isn&#8217;t, in fact, accurate.&#8221; <br /><br />Yet, the perception had a significant toll on &#8216;Brand Canada&#8217; with a <a href="https://thepienews.com/after-the-cap-the-reality-check-for-canadas-international-education-sector/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">decline in student numbers</a> and &#8220;lots of room between between the current number of students and the ceiling of the cap,&#8221; said Bezo.</p>



<p>&#8220;We’re still at an early stage looking at new student flows,&#8221; she added. The recruitment approach of Canada&#8217;s institutions are evolving, for some that means returning to traditional markets while for others its leaning into new markets.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s varied, driven by the unique context of each institution,&#8221; explained Bezo.</p>



<p>One positive change that Bezo takes from this period of turmoil is that it &#8220;has opened door to some very good engagement&#8221; with government. Looking ahead, Bezo hopes to see greater policy stability, along with more &#8220;thoughtful and intentional discussion around global talent strategy&#8221;.</p>



<p>A new global campaign is also in development, bringing together a range of stakeholders, including business associations. One of its key goals is to communicate more clearly the opportunities that exist in Canada. <br /><br />The campaign will also include a domestic component aimed at strengthening social licence – highlighting and sharing the value that international students bring to communities across the country.<br /></p>



<p><br /></p>

<p>Of all the updates, New Zealand’s was among the most upbeat, with social licence emerging as a central theme. Marie Clark, director of insights at Education New Zealand (<a href="https://www.enz.govt.nz/">ENZ</a>), outlined a sector intent on recovery and renewal, with a strategy built around sustainable growth &#8220;grounded in public support and student success&#8221;.</p>



<p>In July 2025, the New Zealand government launched the<em>&nbsp;International Education Going for Growth</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://thepienews.com/nz-debuts-growth-plan-as-it-eyes-35k-more-international-students/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">plan</a>, as part of its broader<em>&nbsp;Going for Growth</em>&nbsp;strategy. Goals include increasing international student enrolments from 83,700 to 119,000 by 2034 and doubling the sector’s value from NZ$3.6 billion to NZ$7.2 billion.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re cautious about policy shifts in New Zealand,&#8221; said Clark, but there have been a few <a href="https://thepienews.com/nz-debuts-growth-plan-as-it-eyes-35k-more-international-students/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">policy changes</a> such as an increase in the permitted work hours for eligible study visa holders from 20 to 25 hours per week, and the introduction of a a short-term post-study work visa for some vocational graduates.</p>



<p>&#8220;We see that as a clever compromise that supports student aspirations, but aligns with skills needs,&#8221; said Clark. </p>



<p>Through such changes, New Zealand is sending a &#8220;signal&#8221; to students that the government is offering &#8220;real opportunities and is serious about growing the sector&#8221; but in a way that benefits the communities that students are going to.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We’ll never be the biggest destination but we want to be the destination of choice<br /><sub><strong><sup>Marie Clark, Education New Zealand</sup></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>



<p>&#8220;We’ll never be the biggest destination but we want to be the destination of choice,&#8221; said Clark.<br /><br />In ENZ&#8217;s<a href="https://www.enz.govt.nz/news-and-research/ed-news/annual-survey-shows-continuing-strong-support-for-international-students-in-new-zealand" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"> latest survey</a>, 72% of New Zealanders said they believe that international education is beneficial to the country, and 77% would like to see at least the same number or more international students welcomed to the country. Clark said ENZ is keeping a close eye on social licence as it is aware that &#8220;rapid growth without public support can backfire&#8221;.<br /><br />The atmosphere at this year’s AIEC conference was noticeably more positive than last year, with Australian providers seeming to have adapted to operating under the government’s <a href="https://thepienews.com/2026-nosc-allocations-rise-for-australian-public-universities/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">international student enrolment limits</a>. <br /><br />Yet, according to Phil Honeywood, CEO of the International Education Association of Australia (<a href="https://www.ieaa.org.au/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">IEAA</a>), there is still work to be done in the policy space. At the top of Honeywood’s agenda is securing federal support to launch a national social licence campaign.<br /><br />Elsewhere, the sector is still grappling with the fact that Australia has the <a href="https://thepienews.com/cost-of-australian-student-visa-jumps-to-aud2000/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">world’s highest</a> student visa application fee but Honeywood remains optimistic that <a href="https://thepienews.com/australias-peak-bodies-urge-visa-fee-reduction-in-letter-to-prime-minister/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">lobbying efforts</a> to significantly reduce the fee for certain short-term student cohorts will be successful.</p>



<p>A significant opportunity for Australian providers lies in the government’s current focus on engagement with South East Asia. Providers that demonstrate a shift away from traditional markets, such as China and India, toward Southeast Asian countries may become eligible for an increased allocation of international student places under the government’s National Planning Level (NPL).</p>



<p>Similarly, initiatives to expand housing through purpose-built student accommodation can also earn universities additional student places.</p>



<p>Honeywood also addressed Australia’s skills agenda, referencing Jobs and Skills Australia’s <em><a href="https://www.jobsandskills.gov.au/research/studies/international-students-pathways-and-outcomes-study" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">International Students Pathways and Outcomes Study</a></em>, which tracks international students’ education and labour market outcomes. While the report highlights skills needed for Australia’s economy, Honeywood urged a broader perspective.</p>



<p>&#8220;When we internalise the skill needs of our economies, we do our neighbouring countries a disservice,&#8221; he told the Canberra audience.</p>



<p>&#8220;We also have, as advanced economies, a global responsibility to provide skills to countries – particularly in our region –&nbsp;that may be totally different skills needs than what our economy requires,&#8221; said Honeywood.</p>



<p><strong><em>The 2026 AIEC conference will take place in Sydney from 27-30 October where colleagues will gather to tackle the theme &#8216;future thinking&#8217;.</em></strong></p>

What universities don’t know about their agents could cost them

### 본문
<p>In my recent piece for&nbsp;<a href="https://thepienews.com/the-fragile-future-of-uk-international-student-recruitment/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>The PIE</em></a>, I argued that the UK’s reliance on international student fee income has never been greater but that it has also never been more fragile. The same is true of the way we recruit these students.</p>



<p>At the recent SAMS Global conference, an anonymous survey of the university representatives attending suggested that institutions are, on average, working with far larger agent networks than many might expect. More than seven in 10 (72%) reported working with over 100 agents, while 16% said their university had relationships with more than 300. And that’s before we add aggregators to the mix, where a single partnership can potentially mean exposure to thousands of sub-agents, most of whom the university may never know or directly interact with.</p>



<p>On the face of it, this scale looks like diversification. But in practice, the sector remains highly concentrated. A small number of large agencies dominate the market. Even if a university has 200 agents on its books, a handful typically account for the majority of enrolments.</p>



<p>And yet, how much do universities really know about these agencies? According to the survey, many institutions use sophisticated CRM systems such as Salesforce, Dynamics or Azorus to manage their own student pipelines. It would be naïve to think the major agents aren’t doing the same. But how many universities actively ask about their agents’ systems, data management, or student-facing processes? Very few. The assumption seems to be that once an agent is signed up, the university’s responsibility largely stops at training and commission payments.</p>



<p>This lack of curiosity extends to the most important element: communication with students. Universities often say they want their messages to reach students directly, but in reality agents are often the filter. Students hear the agent’s version of the institution – sometimes accurate, sometimes distorted, often shaped to maximise conversion. Reciprocity rarely goes both ways. </p>



<p>Universities don’t see what’s being said on their behalf. But why not? Are institutions simply failing to ask, or are agents deliberately keeping those communications hidden? Either way, the result is the same: universities are blind to how their own reputations are being packaged and sold.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">

</blockquote>



<p>Several SAMS Global survey respondents acknowledged this tension. Some argued that communications should be a joint responsibility – “agents are our representatives, and we should know what they are saying” – while others admitted that universities lacked the resources to oversee this properly. A few leaned on <a href="https://www.britishcouncil.org/education/agents-counsellors/uk-quality-agent-framework" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the AQF</a> as a sign of progress, but the reality is that monitoring remains sporadic, inconsistent, and often symbolic rather than substantive.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, costs continue to spiral. Universities are paying more not only because a growing share of students come through agents, but also because commission rates themselves are climbing. In competitive markets, institutions are offering higher rates, incentives, and bonuses, effectively bidding against each other for the same students. It has become a race to the top on commissions, without serious reflection on whether this is sustainable or even effective.</p>



<p>This is the crux of the issue. By outsourcing ever more of their student recruitment to agents without adequate oversight of systems or communications, universities are not just outsourcing the task of recruitment. They are outsourcing their compliance, their reputation, and ultimately their financial resilience. The current model of “more agents, higher commissions” may deliver short-term enrolments, but it risks undermining long-term sustainability.</p>



<p>So where does this leave us? I’d suggest three questions for universities to grapple with:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Should institutions be doing more to understand the systems their agents use and how they interact with prospective students?</li>



<li>How far should oversight of agent–student communication go, and what does genuine shared responsibility look like?</li>



<li>And is the current model of rising commissions sustainable, or are universities pushing themselves into an ever more fragile cycle?</li>
</ul>



<p>We can’t afford to ignore these questions. As reliance on agents grows, the gap between what universities&nbsp;<em>think</em>&nbsp;they know about their networks and what is actually happening on the ground could prove costly for students, for universities, and for the UK’s reputation as a study destination.</p>
