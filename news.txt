Paris-based cryptocurrency firm Blockchain Group has acquired $68 million of Bitcoin, joining a growing wave of European institutions adding BTC to their balance sheets.

The Blockchain Group, which claims to be Europe’s first Bitcoin treasury firm, has acquired 624 Bitcoin (BTC) for 60.2 million euros ($68.7 million).

The latest acquisition brings the firm’s total holdings to 1,471 Bitcoin, or over $154 million, with a BTC yield of 1,097.6% YTD, the Blockchain Group announced in a June 3 X post.

Institutional interest has grown since the US approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January 2024, introducing the first fully regulated BTC investment vehicles for traditional investors.

Corporate appetite saw another significant uptick on March 7 after US President Donald Trump issued an executive order outlining a plan to create a Bitcoin reserve using crypto seized in criminal cases.

Despite Bitcoin’s economic model favoring the early adopters, only a few European companies have displayed Bitcoin treasury ambitions. These include French banking giant BNP Paribas, Swiss firm 21Shares AG, VanEck Europe, Malta-based Jacobi Asset Management and Austrian fintech firm Bitpanda.

The Czech National Bank has also publicly explored using Bitcoin as a diversification strategy for its foreign exchange reserves.

In the market, Bitcoin is set to “consolidate between $103,000 and $108,000” after reaching the $112,000 all-time high on May 22, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.

“Still, onchain data shows continued whale accumulation, which shows a bullish signal; this frames any further corrections as a potential entry point,” the analyst told Cointelegraph.

Bitcoin’s corporate treasury adoption is on the rise worldwide

Bitcoin treasury firms like Michael Saylor’s Strategy have spearheaded global Bitcoin adoption efforts.

Strategy, the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with over $60.5 billion worth of BTC, is now about $8.3 billion away from surpassing BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, currently worth over $68.9 billion, according to Arkham Intelligence.

Strategy bought $75 million worth of Bitcoin between May 26 and 30, at an average price of $106,495 per BTC.

On June 2, Strategy announced plans to raise $250 million through an initial public offering of a new class of perpetual preferred stocks to fund its future Bitcoin acquisitions.

Meanwhile, Metaplanet, also known as “Asia’s MicroStrategy,” became the world’s eighth-largest Bitcoin holder after a $118 million Bitcoin investment on June 2, Cointelegraph reported.

Strategy Expands Capital Stack With Launch of High-Yield STRD Preferred Shares

New 10% non-cumulative perpetual preferred sits below STRF and STRK in seniority, offering investors long-duration yield exposure with zero fees.

Strategy (MSTR) has launched its third perpetual preferred instrument, the Series A Stride Preferred Stock (STRD), as it continues building out a structured yield curve for its capital stack.

With a 10.00% non-cumulative fixed dividend and perpetual duration, STRD aims to provide long-term, high-yield exposure positioned between the firm's senior preferred (STRF) and convertible preferred (STRK) offerings.

Unlike STRF, which offers a senior claim and is designed to be overcollateralized with lower volatility—comparable to investment-grade securities STRD is junior in seniority but delivers the highest yield of Strategy’s preferred offerings.

STRK, by contrast, sits between the two in both risk and return, offering an 8% fixed dividend and convertibility. At the base of the capital stack lies MSTR, the firm’s common stock and primary vehicle for leveraged bitcoin exposure.

According to Strategy, STRD is non-callable under normal conditions, but may be repurchased upon a “fundamental change” or select tax events. Its quarterly dividends are discretionary and paid in cash only when declared by the board.

In the broader market, STRD compares favorably against other preferred equity and high-yield bond funds. With a 10% yield and zero management fees, STRD offers a compelling alternative to ETFs like PFF (7% yield, 0.46% fee) and USHY (8% yield, 0.08% fee), while maintaining comparable volatility levels.

The STRD offering supports Strategy’s broader initiative to offer diversified, structured exposures that span from stable yield to high-conviction digital asset plays anchoring a new approach to capital structuring in the digital era.

US visa interview freeze threatens incoming students

<li>Uncertainty grows for students as some receive visas mid-freeze and others see visa appointments cancelled.</li>



<li>Stricter social media vetting policy currently only rolled out to Harvard students amid Donald Trump&#8217;s ongoing feud with the US&#8217;s oldest university, with possibility of being adopted nationwide in the future.</li>



<li>Speculation grows about duration of the pause, as State Department spokesperson indicates it might end &#8220;sooner rather than later&#8221;.</li>
</ul>

<p>US stakeholders have issued grave warnings about the State Department’s ongoing pause of the scheduling of new student visa interviews, urging the government to lift the freeze and end the uncertainty for students due to enrol in summer and fall cycles of 2025. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“We encourage the State Department to act expeditiously to implement any new vetting measures so new student visas can continue to be quickly and efficiently processed,” wrote the American Council on Education (ACE) president Ted Mitchell, in a letter to secretary of state Marco Rubio. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It comes after the administration <a href="https://thepienews.com/us-trump-pauses-new-student-visa-interviews/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">ordered US consulates</a> around the world to stop scheduling new visa appointments for international students while it expands its social media vetting processes, according to a State Department cable on May 27. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, the policy has only been rolled out to prospective Harvard students, who are being vetted for antisemitism in what the state department has called a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/30/state-implements-reviews-of-harvard-visa-applicants-social-media-accounts-00375921" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">pilot project</a> that could be rolled out nationwide, according to a cable obtained by <em>Politico. </em> </p>



<p>The letter, co-signed by 38 US organisations including the likes of NAFSA and the Presidents’ Alliance, emphasises the severe damage of the pause not only for students already due to come to the US, but also for the country’s international standing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are concerned that imposing a broad pause on all student visas would send a message that our nation no longer welcomes talented students and scholars from other countries,” it said, while reaffirming the sector’s willingness to address the administration’s “security concerns” about international students. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Amid growing fears of an extended delay, Mitchell called on the State Department to “take proactive actions to quickly process student visa applications after the pause” in the lead up to the 2025/26 academic year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Speaking to <em>The PIE News </em>at the NAFSA conference 2025, Presidents’ Alliance CEO Miriam Fledblum said the timing of the pause was particularly concerning, coming at peak time for students applying for visa interviews to give them time to arrive before the fall semester.  </p>



<p>“Even if they quickly reverse course, already damage has been done. Those slots for visa interviews may no longer be available,” said Feldblum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is not theoretical, this is not some time in the future. This is now and this is consequential,” she added.</p>



<p>NAFSA CEO, Fanta Aw, called Rubio’s order another “misguided” and “troubling” attack on international students in the US, which coincided with international stakeholders convening in San Diego for the first day of NAFSA 2025. &nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Rubio’s May 27 cable, the pause in visa interviews applied from the day it was announced “until further guidance” with stakeholders reassuring students who already had appointments that they would remain in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While some students have received visas since the pause, elsewhere visa appointments have been cancelled, with uncertainty growing each day the freeze continues. &nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This is not theoretical, this is not some time in the future. This is now and this is consequential.</p>
<cite>Miriam Feldblum, Presidents&#8217; Alliance</cite></blockquote>



<p>Stakeholders have bemoaned the lack of clarity and transparency of State Department communications, with Mitchell and the co-signatories on ACE’s letter appealing for clearer policy guidance from the government. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, a televised <a href="https://www.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-may-29-2025/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">press briefing</a> last week fuelled further speculation about the duration of the pause, after State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said she thought the freeze would be lifted “sooner rather than later”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But [what] I’m told to encourage people to do is to regularly check to see when those spaces open, and I would not be recommending that if it was going to be weeks or months,” Bruce told reporters.  </p>



<p>Learning from the administration’s past actions, Alliance for International Exchange CEO Mark Overmann urged NAFSA delegates to plan for the possibility of an extended freeze, reminding them about the previous apparent <a href="https://thepienews.com/us-state-department-pauses-study-abroad-funding/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">15-day pause</a> on study abroad funding, which lasted for nearly two months. </p>



<p>“We need to make clear about why this is so disruptive and how likely it is that it will cause chaos,” urged Feldblum. “What I hear from institutional leaders is we were very concerned about the decline in yield because of what has happened up to now. </p>



<p>“This will certainly just instil further uncertainty among prospective international students so we’re even more likely to see declines in acceptances,” she warned. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When pressed for more details, State Department officials maintained that social media vetting was not new: “Since 2019, the Department of State has required visa applicants to provide social media identifiers on immigrant and non-immigrant applications,” they said, referring all other questions to consular officials.  </p>



<p>Despite this, recent months have seen “extreme vetting” of those who may have participated in pro-Palestinian protests, with the expectation that this will be rolled out to all international applicants down the line. &nbsp;</p>
