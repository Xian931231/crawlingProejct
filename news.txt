Today in crypto, the US Senate has passed the GENIUS stablecoin bill, marking a key step as the legislation moves to the House. Meanwhile, Thailand has suspended taxes on crypto income for the next five years, and Bitcoin returned gains amid rising tensions in the Middle East.

US Senate passes GENIUS stablecoin bill in 68-30 vote

The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, is one step closer to becoming law in the US after the US Senate voted to pass an amended version of the bill.

In a Tuesday vote of 68-30, a majority of the US Senate chose to pass the GENIUS Act roughly six weeks after Tennessee Senator Bill Hagerty introduced the legislation. The bill’s companion, the STABLE Act, may be considered in the House of Representatives next, where it could face additional proposals for amendments.

“With this bill, the United States is one step closer to becoming the global leader in crypto,” said Hagerty from the Senate floor before the Tuesday vote, adding: “Once the GENIUS Act is law, businesses of all sizes, and Americans across the country will be able to settle payments nearly instantaneously rather than waiting for days or sometimes even weeks.”

The GENIUS Act initially failed a cloture vote in the Senate in May in response to Democratic opposition to US President Donald Trump’s connections to the cryptocurrency industry. The Trump family has a significant stake in World Liberty Financial, which issued its own USD1 stablecoin in March.

It’s unclear whether the stablecoin legislation will have enough support to pass in the House, where Republicans also hold a slim majority over Democrats. Trump’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, suggested in May that the president would support the bill passed by a Republican-controlled Congress.

Thailand approves five-year crypto tax exemption

Thailand has approved tax exemptions on income from the sale of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for five years, according to a Ministry of Finance announcement.

Thailand will waive the capital gains tax on crypto sales made through licensed crypto asset service providers in the period from Jan. 1, 2025, to Dec. 31, 2029, Deputy Finance Minister Julapun Amornvivat said in a statement issued on Tuesday.

According to the minister, the measure is designed to strengthen Thailand’s position as a global financial hub and one of the first countries to adopt laws for digital assets and their taxation.

The tax measure also aims to promote cryptocurrency trading in Thailand under the supervision of the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies recommended by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

In the statement, the minister highlighted the role of crypto assets in fundraising, which is an important use case for technology and innovation in Thailand.

According to the ministry’s estimations, crypto assets are projected to help the Thai economy expand and increase tax revenue in the medium term “by no less than 1 billion baht,” or $30.7 million.

Bitcoin dips amid reports Trump has called advisers to situation room

Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets dipped after US President Donald Trump left a summit of world leaders and posted an ominous message about Tehran.

Trump has requested that the National Security Council be prepared in the White House Situation Room as he returned early from the G7 summit in Canada on Monday, Fox News reported.

The report comes just hours after Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, with a chilling message: “Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!”

Bitcoin prices reacted immediately with a sharp 2% decline as it shed more than $2,000 over the past few hours.

Bitcoin had earlier strengthened to an intraday high of $108,780, but the latest news sent it back to $106,421 before a minor recovery.

Tron Inc. Deal Gives Justin Sun’s Father Control of Public Firm Via $100M Token Deal

Justin Sun's father, Weike Sun, was appointed Chairman of the Board, and Tron-affiliated executives were added to key board committees.

A Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing posted Monday night outlines the relationship between Tron DAO, Justin Sun, and SRM Entertainment, a Nevada company in the process of changing its name to Tron Inc.

The filing details a $100 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal, paid entirely in TRX TRX$0.27283 tokens, that gives Sun’s father, Weike Sun, board control and positions Tron-aligned advisors in key governance roles.

Weike was named chairman, while Zhihong Liu, also known as Steve Liu, a strategic adviser to Tron DAO and the CEO of stablecoin issuer Techteryx, and Zi Yang, a senior executive at Tronscan, joined the board’s audit, compensation, and nominating committees, according to the filing.

The deal was structured as a private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal. An investment vehicle owned by Weike purchased 100,000 shares of SRM Series B preferred Stock via TRX tokens, convertible into 200 million common shares, and received 220 million warrants at a strike price of $0.50.

Despite the appearance of alignment, Tron DAO has no direct investment, governance rights, or formal role in the SRM deal, said Liu. "Tron DAO is not really any part of the deal for SRM. It’s more of the senior Sun's transaction."

The DAO itself is not mentioned in the 8K filing either. Its influence appears to be indirect, reflected through the backgrounds of newly appointed board members tied to the Tron ecosystem.

According to the Financial Times, the renamed firm plans to buy and hold up to $210 million worth of TRX, similar to how MicroStrategy built a bitcoin-based corporate treasury.

The deal was arranged by Dominari Securities, a brokerage affiliated with Dominari Holdings, whose advisory board includes Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and is located within Trump Tower in Manhattan.

Dominari Securities was paid $50,000 for the counsel for the transaction, according to the 8K filing.

SRM, the listed Tron entity, is down 15%, trading at $7.73 as the market closed in New York. The TRX$0.27283 token is down 2.5%, trading at $0.27.

U.S. Senate Passes GENIUS Act to Regulate Stablecoins, Marking Crypto Industry Win

### 링크
https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/06/17/u-s-senate-passes-genius-act-to-regulate-stablecoins-marking-crypto-industry-win

### 본문
The legislation to set rules for stablecoin issuers is the first major digital assets bill to ever clear the Senate and now moves on to the U.S. House.

The overwhelming bipartisan passage of the U.S. Senate's stablecoin bill, with a 68-30 final vote that saw a huge surge of Democrats joining their Republican counterparts on Tuesday, sets a new high-water mark of crypto policy efforts in the U.S. as the legislation now heads to the House of Representatives.

The major Democratic backing for the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025 (GENIUS) Act helps give it momentum as it lands in the other chamber, where House lawmakers can either vote on it as written or pursue changes that will require a final round in the Senate before it can head to President Donald Trump's desk.

As written, the bill would set up guardrails around the approval and supervision of U.S. issuers of stablecoins, the dollar-based tokens such as the ones backed by Circle, Ripple and Tether. Firms making these digital assets available to U.S. users would have to meet stringent reserve demands, transparency requirements, money-laundering compliance and regulatory supervision that's also likely to include new capital rules.

Ji Kim, the Acting CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, called it a "historic step forward for the digital asset industry," in a prepared statement shared ahead of the vote

"This is a win for the U.S., a win for innovation and a monumental step towards appropriate regulation for digital assets in the United States," said Amanda Tuminelli, executive director and chief legal officer of the DeFi Education Fund, in a similar statement.

While it has failed to convince some of the most vocal Democratic critics such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, who say it allows loopholes for foreign tokens such as Tether's USDT$1.00, doesn't deal with conflicts presented by the personal crypto involvement of President Trump and clears a path for technology giants such as Amazon to issue their own coins, the bill's backers in her party have essentially argued that doing nothing isn't an option.

"With this bill, the United States is one step closer to becoming the global leader in crypto," said Senator Bill Hagerty, the Tennessee Republican who sponsored the bill, as the Senate prepared to vote on Tuesday. "The value of stablecoins will be pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed one-to-one by cash and short-term U.S. Treasuries. This will provide certainty and confidence for more wide-scale adoption of this transformational technology.”

While this is the first significant crypto bill to clear the Senate, it's also the first time a stablecoin bill has passed either chamber, despite years of negotiation in the House Financial Services Committee that managed to produce other major crypto legislation in the previous congressional session.

The destiny of the GENIUS Act is also tied closely to the House's own Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, the more sweeping crypto bill that would establish the legal footing of the wider U.S. crypto markets. The stablecoin effort is slightly ahead of the bigger task of the market structure bill, but the industry and their lawmaker allies argue that they're inextricably connected and need to become law together. So far, the Clarity Act has been cleared by the relevant House committees and awaits floor action.

The crypto industry's lobbyists turn now to the House on both those issues. A new report on Tuesday from TRM Labs says that stablecoins represent more than 60% of current crypto transactions, and more than 90% of those coins are pegged to the U.S. dollar — dominated by USDC and USDT.

"Although TRM estimates that 99% of stablecoin activity is licit, their speed, scale, and liquidity have made them appealing for illicit uses, including ransomware payments, fraud, and terrorist financing," the analytical organization noted.

Illicit finance represents one of the major complaints of critics in Congress.

Don’t blink: US-bound students advised to hold their nerve

### 본문
<p><strong>“</strong>The trend for the last 10 years has actually been the rise of the dominance of US universities &#8211; with the number of institutions with admissions rates below 8% growing dramatically,” explains Beaton, as he outlines how competitive US admissions are for prospective students.</p>



<p>“Schools like NYU, the biggest international recruiter in the US, have gone from a 40% admissions rate down to a 7% admissions rates. Johns Hopkins has gone for 15% to 5%. Duke University has seen double the number applications,” Beaton continues.</p>



<p>The Kiwi entrepreneur has first-hand experience, having himself graduated from Harvard, Standford and Yale in recent years, along with studying at Oxford and King&#8217;s in the UK and Tsinghua in China. </p>



<p>Crimson Education, the company he founded as a 17 year old Harvard student is now valued at over USD $1 billion, specialising in supporting families to apply to the world&#8217;s most prestigious universities.</p>



<p>Beaton believes that the appeal for US education is linked to curriculum design. While many countries have increasingly opted for degree pathways preparing students for specific industry careers, the US system offers more flexibility.   <br /><br />“People need multifaceted subject experiences” he explains. “18-year-olds don&#8217;t know what they want to do and it&#8217;s hard to even guess what the jobs will be in 10 years post their graduation.<br /><br />“Interest in liberal arts is ascending, and I would say the era of the single degree where all classes are one area is relatively declining – it is a structure disadvantage in a world that&#8217;s moving fast.”<br /><br />There is no better example of fast-paced change than US politics, where sweeping changes to legislation are being proposed at break-neck speed.<br /><br />The US government recently made global headlines by <a href="https://thepienews.com/us-trump-pauses-new-student-visa-interviews/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">suspending</a> student visa appointments and <a href="https://thepienews.com/trump-revokes-harvards-ability-to-enrol-international-students/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">limiting the powers</a> of institutions like Harvard University – so what are students making of these news headlines and is it impacting US appeal?</p>



<p>“My average family in China or in Korea or in India [applying through Crimson Education] is not blinking” reveals Beaton.<br /><br />“Basically, they&#8217;re really resolute. You can&#8217;t just wake up one day and decide to apply to America – you normally have a lot of planning, often for four years before you go. What that means is that you need to be default-preparing if you want to go to the US.</p>



<p>&#8220;Often my students will apply to Oxbridge and the US top schools, but the optimal strategy continues to be you build a great US profile and indirectly you’ll build a very good Oxford-UK profile as well.<br /><br />“If you need to, you can take a gap year from the US and if you still want to graduate in four years, you can do advanced standard, which means you do APs and A-levels and you can finish your degree in three years rather than four – which is what I did.<br /><br />“That means you&#8217;ve got up to 18 months past when you apply if you&#8217;re in the Southern Hemisphere, a full year plus your gap between applications being submitted and the result, or in the Northern Hemisphere you have 14 months which is plenty of protection [from any political disruption] and even in a really apocalyptic situation like Covid-19 you can still take online courses from Harvard, or begin an exchange semester.<br /><br />“The number of scenarios where a determined US student has to &#8216;blink&#8217; is not that high. You can&#8217;t be a Canadian-bound applicant who adds Yale the last minute – but you can be a Yale applicant who adds Canada at the last minute.”</p>



<p>The US economy has often been seen as a gold-plated environments for graduates, where they can graduate from top colleges and then progress directly into graduate jobs in finance, tech, medicine or law.</p>



<p>“The US is incredibly resilient,&#8221; continues Beaton. “I would say the American dream is alive and well – the problems we&#8217;re seeing are a function of the fact that the American dream is not as accessible to everyone.</p>



<p><strong>“</strong>President Trump is creating an opportunity for future politicians to ruffle feathers in a way that creates elevated risk for some institutions, but ultimately, I think it&#8217;s largely noise, a way of dominating the news-cycle.<br /><br />“Even if a certain administration was trying to take a wrecking ball through some of these universities, it will be very hard to structurally dislocate how influential and desirable they are on the world stage.</p>



<p><strong>“</strong>If you look at this from the media, Harvard is getting bombed out in all directions. Funding cuts, international student bans, it should be reeling. But I was at the graduation there and it was jubilant excitement. There was a sense of consolidation behind the University president and while there are clearly challenges, the core university is incredibly strong and durable.”</p>

<li>International student hailing from Gujarat one of those tragically killed in devastating air accident.</li>



<li>UK universities issue heartfelt statements mourning the dead as Coventry University confirms two incoming students were killed in the crash.</li>



<li>Institutions issue guidance for international students as leaders look to amp up student support.</li>
</ul>

</div>
</div>


<p>Exceptional, intellectually curious, generous, and a passionate cricket enthusiast – that&#8217;s how professors and friends remember 22-year-old Dirdh Patel, the Gujarat native who was among at least 271 people killed in last week’s tragic Air India Ahmedabad–London flight crash.</p>



<p>Patel, who had been pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the <a href="https://www.hud.ac.uk/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">University of Huddersfield</a> since last year, was living with his brother and sister-in-law in Leeds and working as an AI/ML engineering intern in the UK when he travelled to India for personal reasons.</p>



<p>Riya Parmar, who studied with Patel at Dharmsinh Desai University during their undergraduate years, struggled to come to terms with the tragedy, recalling how she had met him just days before the crash, unaware it would be the last time she saw him.</p>



<p>“He always had a dream to start something of his own. That’s why he decided to go to the UK, to earn in pounds,” Parmar told <em>The PIE News</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We are still in shock that he’s gone, all we have now are memories<br /><strong><sup><sub>Riya Parmar, friend of Dirdh Patel</sub></sup></strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>&#8220;As a student, he was one of the brightest, both in school and university. He always helped his friends with assignments and was our go-to last-minute teacher before exams. And, as a person, so kind and incredibly humble.”</p>



<p>Described as an “extrovert” and deeply “spiritual” at the same time, Patel had always dreamed of travelling across Europe, a dream Parmar still can’t believe he will never get to fulfil.</p>



<p>“We are still in shock that he’s gone, all we have now are memories,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We attended his funeral, and we are all trying our best to support his parents through this difficult time.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the University of Huddersfield, Patel’s passing meant the loss of a standout student, someone who was at the top of his class and well on his way to making a meaningful impact in the world.</p>



<p>“He had a clear ability of seeing the bigger picture and how his learning could lead to making a positive impact in the world. This led him to graduate at the top of his class, achieving the highest average among all MSc AI students in his cohort,” stated Dr George Bargiannis, reader in artificial intelligence, School of Computing and Engineering at the University of Huddersfield, who was a mentor to Patel even after his graduation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coventry University also issued a statement mourning the loss of two incoming students, highlighting the profound impact the tragedy has had on UK universities as students return from travel breaks or prepare to join their respective programs.</p>



<p>“These were young lives filled with dreams, aspirations, and the promise of a bright future. Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with their families and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time,” read a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7340678189142155265-1lka?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADCAmZUB0C_UED0HkxgSoOKsiDQv_RWwjNs" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">statement</a> by Tarang Chowdhury, regional director, South Asia at Coventry University.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Air India Flight 171 crash claimed the lives of 169 Indian nationals, 52 British nationals, seven Portuguese nationals, and one Canadian, leaving only one survivor.</p>



<p>It also killed 30 people on the ground, many of them students from Ahmedabad’s BJ Medical College, sending shockwaves through the international education sectors of both India and the UK, as the tragedy took the lives of not only students but also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/uow-enterprises_in-loving-memory-of-kalyani-brahmbhatt-activity-7340544297571635201-Hq_n" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">professionals</a> within the industry.</p>



<p>“As soon as the news of the crash broke on the news channels, many of our partners – including senior leadership and several vice-chancellors – promptly reached out to enquire about the safety of our staff and students,” said Jasminder Khanna, co-founder of <a href="https://gresham.world/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Gresham Global</a>, a Mumbai-based representation firm supporting recruitment operations for UK universities in South Asia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“While there were some students scheduled to travel to the UK for the summer course, thankfully, none (among partner universities) were on flight AI 131. I had calls and messages from almost all of our partner universities including the non-UK ones.”</p>



<p>The incident also comes just a month after India and the UK <a href="https://thepienews.com/what-does-the-india-uk-trade-deal-mean-for-international-students/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">signed</a> a free trade agreement aimed not only at reducing tariffs and boosting exports, but also at enhancing mobility between the two countries.</p>



<p>The growing bilateral relationship between India and the UK, which now relies heavily on smoother travel between the two countries, has also prompted UK universities to introduce new support measures for their students in India, especially in light of the recent plane crash.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>While we already maintain strong engagement through pre-departure support and arrival briefings, we recognise that situations like this call for more structured and anticipatory outreach<br /><strong><sub><sup>Disha Gupta, Birmingham City University</sup></sub></strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the days following the incident, multiple Air India flights have been cancelled, including a London-bound flight from Ahmedabad that was grounded due to operational issues.</p>



<p>“I am hoping that such incidents never ever happen but it is not under anyone&#8217;s control. We are not advising students for any specific for or against any airlines at all,” stated Jaspreet Kaur, principal adviser (South Asia) supporting <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Queen Mary University of London</a>, UK-India Business Council.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“However, we have been advising to watch out the airspace criteria as there are more issues with the air routes from India to UK at the moment.”</p>



<p>“As soon as news of the crash surfaced, our international recruitment team in South Asia immediately began reaching out to current applicants and partner agents in the region – particularly in Gujarat – to check in, offer reassurance, and provide any necessary support,” stated Disha Gupta, head of operations and recruitment, India, UAE, Nepal and Sri Lanka at <a href="https://www.bcu.ac.uk/">Birmingham City University</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Gupta, in addition to university-wide communications and dedicated counselling and support services, the institution is also introducing wellbeing check-ins throughout the admissions journey, in collaboration with its partners across India.</p>



<p>“While we already maintain strong engagement through pre-departure support and arrival briefings, we recognise that situations like this call for more structured and anticipatory outreach. We are working closely with our internal support teams to see how we can embed this within our wider international student experience strategy,” she added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While India’s directorate general of civil aviation has reportedly found no major safety concerns with Air India’s Dreamliner fleet, the aircraft model involved in the crash, a Reuters report revealed that the aviation authority has requested pilot and dispatcher records from Air India as part of its ongoing investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a separate memo dated June 16, the DGCA has also urged flying schools across the country to “strictly follow additional safety and operational measures”.&nbsp;</p>

Swinburne partners to offer qualifications in Qatar

<p>The first Australian university to offer its qualifications in Qatar, <a href="https://www.swinburne.edu.au/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Swinburne</a> is poised to offer a range of degrees, including in computer science and business, through the partnership with BUC, a newly-established private higher education institute in Doha.</p>



<p>In a statement, Swinburne described it as a &#8220;huge milestone&#8221; – one that reflects its &#8220;commitment to delivering tech-rich, future focused education, now with a global reach&#8221;.</p>



<p><a href="https://buc.edu.qa/">BUC</a> describes itself as &#8220;a forward-thinking institution of higher education&#8230; dedicated to empowering the next generation of leaders, innovators, and professionals&#8221;.</p>



<p>Freshly launched, it aims to offer globally relevant academic programs, industry-aligned training, and a supportive environment that encourages creativity, critical thinking, and career readiness.</p>



<p>&#8220;By combining Swinburne&#8217;s curriculum with BUC’s deep regional insight and industry connections, we&#8217;re equipping students to thrive not only in Australia, but globally,&#8221; commented Swinburne&#8217;s vice-chancellor, Pascale Quester.</p>



<p>&#8220;Swinburne has a bold ambition of being a globally connected and accessible university – where the world truly is our campus. Our partnership with BUC is built on a shared mission to empower students with the skills, knowledge and mindset needed for lifelong success,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p>The inaugural intake of students is set for October 2025.</p>



<p>Vice chairman of BUC, Hassan Al-Derham, said the partnership ensures Qatar&#8217;s next generation &#8220;gains access to top-tier Australian education here at home, aligned with the nation’s vision for innovation and leadership&#8221;.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We are not just offering degrees – we are opening doors. Doors to global classrooms, powerful ideas, and careers that don’t yet exist, but will<br /><strong><sub><sup>Hassan Al-Derham, BUC</sup></sub></strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>“We are not just offering degrees – we are opening doors. Doors to global classrooms, powerful ideas, and careers that don’t yet exist, but will,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>Al-Derham brings to the institute a wealth of experience, having served as president of Qatar University from 2015 to 2023.</p>



<p>BUC’s leadership also includes Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani, a member of the ruling family and former Prime Minister of Qatar from 2013-2020.</p>



<p>The Qatar National Vision 2030 aims to transform the country into a knowledge-based economy, making initiatives like BUC – and its international partnerships – a key part of the nation’s strategy to diversify and strengthen its higher education sector.</p>



<p>In a statement, Swinburne described how the industry-aligned degrees are set to empower students with the practical skills needed for &#8220;Qatar’s evolving economy&#8221; and aligning with the 2030 Vision.</p>
