Tencent explores purchase of Nexon gaming company

Tencent, a Chinese technology and holding company with a global footprint, is reportedly exploring the possibility of acquiring game developer and publisher Nexon.

Representatives from the tech company contacted the family of Nexon founder Kim Jung-ju to explore a potential deal, but no concrete terms have been reached and a deal is not guaranteed, according to Bloomberg.

Nexon is the South Korean video game developer behind the MapleStory series, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that first gained popularity in the early 2000s as a traditional PC game.

Web3 gaming continues to be a closely watched use case for blockchain technology as the ability to give players ownership over in-game assets could create an entirely new asset class and create tens of billions of dollars in capital.

The company integrated blockchain technology in two different installments of the series, MapleStory N and MapleStory Universe, in May 2025, allowing users to collect in-game items and rewards in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTS).

Interest in Web3 gaming surges, but still far from mainstream

According to a February 2025 report from DappRadar, blockchain gaming activity surged by roughly 368% year-over-year in January 2025, driven by games like Off The Grid and the then-upcoming MapleStory N.

Off The Grid is a AAA shooter, published by Gunzilla Games, that features console-level graphics and gameplay similar to that of traditional video game blockbusters produced by major game studios.

This represented a significant departure from traditional Web3 games that typically feature simple gameplay mechanics, cartoonish graphics, and a focus on player rewards rather than robust gameplay.

Despite the initial spike in player interest that started in late 2024, Web3 gaming activity declined by 10%, reflected by a drop in daily unique active wallets, according to DappRadar.

While the crypto gaming sector remains healthy and titles such as MapleStory and Off The Grid reflect a shift to higher quality games focused on player experience, Web3 gaming still faces several headwinds.

Chief among these impediments to widespread Web3 gaming adoption are the technical barrier to entry of setting up a blockchain wallet and the traditional gaming community's aversion to play-to-earn games and other tactics designed to fuse gaming and money.

Solana futures open interest hits $7.4B amid ETF speculation: Is $200 SOL next?

### 본문
Key takeaways:

SOL’s futures open interest surged to a 2-year high, reflecting growing institutional interest.

Rising competition from other blockchains and neutral funding rates continue to dampen SOL’s bullish momentum.

Solana’s SOL (SOL) failed to hold its bullish momentum after gaining 10% between Monday and Thursday. The cryptocurrency has shown weakness after testing the $180 level several times in May, but traders’ growing interest in leveraged positions could open the path to $200 and beyond.

On Wednesday, total open interest on SOL futures reached 46.2 million SOL, the highest in over two years and up 22% from the previous month. Demand from buyers is always matched by sellers, but the rise in activity signals increased participation from institutional investors.

With $7.4 billion in open futures positions, SOL is drawing more attention from savvy market participants. This creates more opportunities for arbitrage strategies like the “carry trade,” where investors buy SOL on the spot market and sell the futures contract. A liquid and active derivatives market supports these trades.

Even with these developments, many SOL investors are likely disappointed. The current $155 level remains well below the $294 all-time high. Meanwhile, the total crypto market cap is just 12% below its record. The sharp drop in Solana network activity has led investors to lower expectations for future SOL gains, making a return to $200 less likely.

Decentralized exchange (DEX) activity on Solana dropped to $10.5 billion per week, down from $29.2 billion just 30 days earlier. More notably, the 50% DEX market share peak in early January proved unsustainable, especially as trading volumes rose on BNB Chain and Hyperliquid became the clear leader in perpetual futures.

Unlike the Ethereum ecosystem, which involves more friction due to its reliance on layer-2 scaling solutions, BNB Chain competes directly with Solana by offering low fees and integrated tools for token launches. Its seamless connection with the Binance exchange also gives BNB Chain a clear edge in user experience.

SOL funding neutral as competition weakens investor confidence

To assess whether traders are turning bearish on SOL due to its recent underperformance and rising competition, it’s useful to examine perpetual futures funding rates. In a neutral market, funding should range between 5% and 15% annually, signaling that buyers (longs) are paying a premium to hold their positions.

The funding rate for SOL has fluctuated between neutral and slightly bearish levels, clearly moving away from the negative 7% seen on Saturday. More importantly, SOL futures have failed to hold above the 15% annualized funding threshold over the past 30 days, indicating a lack of strong bullish sentiment.

Speculation around a potential spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) for SOL in the United States remains the most significant short-term price catalyst. Bloomberg analysts are confident that the US Securities and Exchange Commission will approve ETFs for Litecoin (LTC), SOL, and XRP by the end of the year.

At the moment, there is no clear sign that SOL is on track to reach $200, especially given the neutral funding rates in perpetual futures. Additionally, rising competition among decentralized applications has likely played a major role in weakening investor expectations for SOL.

Shift to digital asset technology won&#039;t be &#039;slow&#039; — Franklin Templeton CEO

### 본문
In an opinion piece published in Fortune, Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson wrote that the “advantages of blockchain are so compelling that we don’t foresee the shift to digital asset technology being slow or incremental,” echoing the growing positive sentiment some traditional finance institutions have toward crypto.

“Indeed, we expect our industry will evolve more in the next five years than in the last 50,” Johnson said. “The pressing question is whether financial institutions will choose to embrace the digital asset wave (and the disruption coming with it), actively fight it or bury its head in the sand.”

Johnson noted that blockchain technology and the growing cryptosphere have many benefits that traditional finance rails struggle to match. These include new financial options for homeowners, integration of global markets, and, eventually, throughput that could reach hundreds of thousands or even millions of transactions per second.

Franklin Templeton, one of the world’s largest asset managers with $1.5 trillion assets under management (AUM), has been involved in digital assets since at least 2021 when it launched its OnChain US Government Money Fund.

The company has launched a Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) index exchange-traded fund and brought its tokenized US government money market fund to different blockchains, including Solana and Base. On Tuesday, it debuted an intraday yield feature that uses blockchain technology.

Traditional finance institutions launch crypto products

Traditional financial institutions are growing increasingly enthusiastic about crypto, spotting opportunities to make their clients (and themselves) money.

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with $11.6 trillion AUM, has launched Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and had representatives speak with the US SEC about various topics. BlackRock’s US spot Bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), is the largest in its class, containing $72.6 billion in net assets.

JPMorgan Chase has been in crypto at least since 2020 when it launched its JPM Coin, a dollar-pegged stablecoin. On June 4, a report indicated that the institution would soon begin accepting crypto ETFs as collateral for loans. On May 20, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the firm’s clients would soon be able to buy Bitcoin, although the firm would not custody it.

However, not all are pleased about the growing ties between crypto and traditional finance. On Thursday, outgoing Financial Stability Board Chair Klaas Knot warned that while crypto does not, as of yet, pose a risk to traditional finance, “we may be approaching a tipping point here.” According to Knot, areas of concern include crypto ETFs and stablecoins.

Ethereum Treasury Firm SharpLink Gaming Plunges 70% – But There May Be a Twist

The company earlier raised $450 million in a private placement round from investors to pursue an ETH reserve strategy.

SharpLink Gaming (SBET), a Nasdaq-listed company that is pursuing an ether ETH$2,491.42 treasury strategy, tumbled 70% on Thursday in after-hours trading following a fresh filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The company submitted an S-3ASR registration statement, enabling the resale of up to 58,699,760 shares related to its private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing.

The Thursday filing allows more than 100 shareholders in the PIPE round to sell their shares, effectively flooding the market and triggering a post-close sell-off, Charles Allen, CEO of BTCS, a publicly-traded firm that's pursuing crypto reserve strategy, explained in an X post and an interview with CoinDesk.

The company raised $450 million earlier this month through a PIPE round from a wide range of investors, including ConsenSys, Galaxy, and Pantera Capital, to acquire ETH for its treasury. Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys CEO Joseph Lubin also joined the firm as board chairman.

However, there may be a larger strategy behind the latest move.

Allen said in an X post that he thinks the company may have quietly raised up to $1 billion to buy more ETH using an at-the-market (ATM) offering that was previously announced in a May 30 SEC filing.

"If they played cards right, they would expect a surprise PR tomorrow with $1B of ETH purchases, which could light the match to reignite the stock," he said.

ETH is down 4.1% over the past 24 hours at around $2,650 as bitcoin and the broader crypto markets slid.

Troubling macro headlines concerning the Middle East and tariffs failed to shake U.S. stocks, but cryptocurrencies sold off.

Cryptocurrencies were broadly lower on Thursday, with the selloff picking up steam in the early U.S. evening hours.

Bitcoin BTC$103,295.60 slipped more than 2.5% over the past 24 hours to $105,900, but the declines were far steeper in altcoins, with ether ETH$2,489.94, solana SOL$143.51, XRP XRP$2.12 and dogecoin DOGE$0.17229 among those tokens sporting 5%-7% drops.

Risk assets in general got off to a poor start Thursday as President Trump threatened renewed tariff measures as the early July deadline for trade deals begins to get near.

In addition, with nuclear negotiations with Iran not going well, there were boosted fears of Israeli strikes against Iranian nuclear sites.

“Look, there’s a chance of massive conflict,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday. “We have a lot of American people in this area, and I said, we’ve got to tell them to get out, because something could happen soon, and I don’t want to be the one that didn’t give any warning and missiles are flying.”

“I don’t want to say imminent, but it looks like it’s something that could very well happen,” Trump said about Israel potentially striking Iran. He stated that he had advised against an attack while negotiations were ongoing.

While U.S. stocks were able to shake off the headlines and close with modest gains, cryptos weren't so lucky.

The rally in risk assets — crypto included — over the past several weeks has taken place amid a U.S. Federal Reserve seemingly determined not to ease monetary policy for the foreseeable future.

And yet, there continue to be signs that weak economic data may soon force the Fed's hand — a far slowed pace of employment gains and weaker inflation numbers among them. Two more data points arrived Thursday in May's Producer Price Index, which came in softer than forecast on both the headline and core levels, and initial jobless claims, which unexpectedly matched last week's multi-month high of 248,000.

Continuing jobless claims rose to 1.956 million, the third consecutive gain and the highest level since November 2021.

President Trump continued his crusade to goad Fed Chair Jerome Powell into a more dovish posture, calling him a "numbskull" for not cutting rates. "I may have to force something," threatened Trump. Powell's term as Fed boss doesn't end until 2026 and the president had previously said firing him prior to that was not an option.

Fulbright board resigns, citing Trump’s political interference

### 본문
<p>In a <a href="https://substack.com/inbox/post/165673358?r=17cemi" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">statement</a> on June 12, board members said the administration had “usurped” its authority and denied Fulbright awards to a “substantial number of individuals” chosen by the board under its congressionally mandated powers. </p>



<p>It said members had &#8220;overwhelmingly&#8221; voted to quit the board, with their resignation effective immediately.</p>



<p>The members accused the administration of “subjecting an additional 1,200 foreign Fulbright recipients to an unauthorized review process” that could lead to more applicants being rejected.</p>



<p>“Through generations of war and peace, the Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Program has been a bipartisan pillar of American diplomacy,” said members, highlighting the “exhaustive” year-long process of granting scholarships, which they say has been overridden by State Department officials. &nbsp;</p>



<p>For its part, the state department has called the 12 board members “partisan political appointees of the Biden administration,” claiming their resignation is a “political stunt” attempting to undermine the Trump administration. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s ridiculous to believe that these members would continue to have final say over the application process, especially when it comes to determining academic suitability and alignment with President Trump’s Executive Orders,” a senior state department official told <em>The PIE News. </em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Study abroad colleagues and former Fulbright scholars have taken to social media, expressing support for the board members and highlighting the huge soft power benefits of “one of the most respected international exchange programs in the world”. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As of Wednesday afternoon, the <a href="https://www.state.gov/fulbright-foreign-scholarship-board/#ffsb-members" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Fulbright membership page</a> on the state department website listed only one name: Carmen Estrada-Schaye, who was appointed to the board in 2022. </p>



<p>“I was appointed by the president of the United States and I intend to fill out my term,” Estrada-Schaye told <em>The Associated Press</em>. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>To continue to serve &#8230; would risk legitimising actions we believe are unlawful and damage America&#8217;s credibility abroad</p>
<cite>Fulbright Scholarship board members</cite></blockquote>



<p>“We are frankly stunned that the distinguished Fulbright board was backed into a corner by the Trump Administration and saw no alternative but to resign,” AIFS chairman Bill Gertz told <em>The PIE News. </em> </p>



<p>“Fulbright enjoys bipartisan support in Congress,” said Gertz, adding that he expected this, and all cultural exchanges, to be fully funded in 2026 and beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The news comes as the sector is bracing for the president&#8217;s FY 2026 “skinny” budget, with Trump currently proposing <a href="https://thepienews.com/campaign-builds-to-save-decimation-of-us-study-abroad/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">cutting international exchanges</a> by 93%, though these plans are yet to be approved by Congress. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Founded in 1946, each year the Fulbright Program provides approximately 8,000 merit-based grants to students, scholars and professionals pursuing graduate studies, conducting research, or teaching English abroad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grants are awarded to US students and international students from 160 countries, with the scholarship considered a key pillar of American public diplomacy and soft power. &nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Our resignation is not a decision we take lightly,&#8221; wrote members: &#8220;But to continue to serve after the Administration has consistently ignored the board’s request that they follow the law would risk legitimising actions we believe are unlawful and damage the integrity of this storied program and America’s credibility abroad.&#8221;</p>



<p>As highlighted by the board members, Fulbright alumni have gone on to become leaders of government, industry, academia, arts and culture “in every part of the world”. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Sixty-two Fulbright alumni have been awarded the Nobel Prize, while 44 Fulbright recipients have served as heads of state or government, according to the State Department.</p>



<p>While the program is sponsored by the State Department, over 35 foreign governments match or exceed the US government’s annual contributions. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Board member Ambassador James Costos said he voted to resign the board “not in protest, but in defence of principle”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a statement on June 11, Costos highlighted Fulbright’s “extraordinary role in advancing international education and cultural diplomacy,” forming bonds that “serve as the strongest defence against global conflict”. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“That is the essence of soft power. That is the Fulbright legacy,” wrote Costos, maintaining that he believed in that legacy too deeply to stand by “as it is compromised”.&nbsp;</p>

UK: Sector will “pay the price” for rapid expansion at mid-ranking universities

<p><strong>Additional reporting by Nicholas Cuthbert</strong></p>


<div class="summary-container bg-orange-200 px-4 py-[22px]">
	<div class="prose max-w-none dark:prose-invert text-black">

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Immigration white paper brings compliance conversations to the fore as Tony Blair&#8217;s Home Secretary questions rapid rise in international students at mid-ranking institutions.</li>



<li>Sector hits back at comments, pointing out that consequences of compliance not worth it for institutions.</li>



<li>Concerns also raised about asylum claims, as reports suggest some students are using route to extend stay in UK.</li>
</ul>

</div>
</div>


<p>Jack Straw, who served as Home Secretary between 1997 and 2001, pointed to parts of the recently released<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restoring-control-over-the-immigration-system-white-paper" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"> immigration white paper</a> that showed universities ranked between 600 an 1,200 by the Times Higher Education had &#8220;expanded dramatically&#8221; in terms of their international intake.</p>



<p>&#8220;There has to be a question there about the fact that some universities in that category have been chasing students and not paying attention to rigorous controls,&#8221; he told delegates at Duolingo English Test&#8217;s inaugural DETcon London yesterday. &#8220;And if you do that, the rest of the sector will pay the price.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You may be complaining about that, but that&#8217;s just where it is,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>He highlighted the raft of stricter controls on international students highlighted in the white paper – which includes more stringent English language requirements and <a href="https://thepienews.com/visa-refusals-study-in-uk/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">higher thresholds </a>for the Basic Compliance Assessment (BCA) – saying that he was &#8220;in no doubt&#8221; these would come into force in time.</p>



<p>While the effect of these tighter regulations could &#8220;squeeze&#8230; some universities&#8221;, some of their business models up until this point had not been sustainable, he said. Straw went so far as to tell <em>The PIE News</em> that it was inevitable some universities would go bust.</p>



<p>Straw&#8217;s comments drew ire from delegates at the conference – some of whom dismissed the claims as &#8220;rubbish&#8221;, while others were at pains to point out the high compliance rate in the sector.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>You may be complaining about that, but that&#8217;s just where it is<br /><strong><sup><sub>Jack Straw, former Home Secretary</sub></sup></strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Speaking in a panel discussion later on at the event, deputy vice-chancellor at the University of Portsmouth, Chris Chang, said the notion that only certain institutons should be able to recruit international students was &#8220;nonsense&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Half of the international staff [at this conference] would not be here today. I wouldn&#8217;t be here today because I&#8217;m went to study at a post-92 institution,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At the end of the day, I think that&#8217;s rubbish. I will be brave enough to say that.&#8221;</p>



<p>He stressed that his university doesn&#8217;t &#8220;take sides&#8221;, instead offering choice and options for international students. And, he added, it is in institutions&#8217; best interests to pay heed to immigration controls. </p>



<p>&#8220;We need to protect our sponsorship license – and that&#8217;s right, we need to take immigration policy seriously, that&#8217;s our duty. But we still offer choice and different people have different drivers,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Anne Marie Graham, UKCISA chief executive, defended the UK&#8217;s higher education sector as being &#8220;extremely compliant&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not to say it is 100% compliant – there will be issue that arise – but what we don&#8217;t hear in that public narrative is how the UKVI and institutions work collaboratively to identify trends and work to eradicate problems,&#8221; she told The PIE. </p>



<p>She continued: &#8220;It&#8217;s in no sponsors&#8217; interest to be noncompliant, they would lose their licence if they were to do so.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, HEPI director Nick Hillman took aim at the Home Office&#8217;s attitude towards international education in the UK – shown in its emphasis upon compliance at universities in the <a href="https://thepienews.com/breaking-uk-graduate-route-reduced-to-18-months-under-immigration-white-paper/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">immigration white paper</a>. Speaking to The PIE, he paid particular mind to the squeezed BCA thresholds.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think that it was quite a clever move of the government to put that crack down on compliance in the white paper because it is the sort of thing [mainstream] journalists overlook, but it is critically important and a good number of universities are very close to those new, reduced thresholds and they are going to have to look very carefully at their numbers,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>And he said the sector always faced an &#8220;existential crisis&#8221; in the rare cases when institutions were banned from recruiting international students. </p>



<p>&#8220;There are a lot of different factors to do with compliance, some of which are in the control of the university, and some are to do with geopolitical factors. You suddenly find you&#8217;ve got far more applicants from one part of the world that you have traditionally recruited from,&#8221; he said. &#8220;These numbers can go up and down by more than people realise year to year and I think the Home Office are trying to pull a fast one in making it look much simpler than it feels to people on the ground.&#8221;</p>



<p>Speaking at DETCon London, Straw also took a hard line on reports of international students applying for asylum – which also formed a sizeable part of the immigration white paper as the government took swipes at those it claims are doing so disingenuously as a way to extend their time in the UK.</p>



<p>The white paper drew attention to an increasing number of asylum clams for students coming to the end of their course &#8220;even though nothing substantive has changed in their home country while they have been in the UK&#8221;. It pointed to figures showing that around 30% of asylum claims in the UK come from visa holders, with 47% of this number coming from students.</p>



<p>While Straw pointed out that some of these claims would be genuine, he hit out at the practice as a whole, calling it &#8220;a racket&#8230; we should have no truck with&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Everybody knows it&#8217;s a racket. And there are a lot of people, particularly immigration advisors and lawyers, who are making money out of this racket,&#8221; he stressed. &#8220;We should deal with it.&#8221;</p>
